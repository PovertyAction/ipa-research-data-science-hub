The standard syntax of Stata commands is as follows:\n[by varlist]: command [varlist] [=exp] [if exp] [in range] [weight] [using filename][, options]\nWhere varlist denotes a list of variable names, command denotes a Stata command, exp denotes an algebraic expression, range denotes an observation range, weight denotes a weighting expression, and options denotes a list of command-specific options. In other words, this means that any Stata command we run is accompanied by multiple options (in brackets) that alter the output we receive from said command. Other than the command itself, everything in brackets is optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStata is case sensitive!\n\n\n\nAnother important thing about syntax: Stata commands and syntax never come in CAPITAL LETTERS.

SurveyCTO data, especially, has tools that aid import into Stata. Deciding the data structure during survey programming provides important benefits for raw data management.\nSurvey data’s structure also carries unique challenges for data management: formats of survey data and responses need to be standardized for analysis, metadata needs to be added to surveys, and corrections need to be completed. Finally, since survey data often holds many sources of personally identifying information in the raw format, deidentification is often very important and requires specific focus. Changes in survey version content may exacerbate this process and require multiple imports. This section provides information on these tasks. This section does not provide information on how to program surveys to make data management easy.\nIPA has developed tools to support survey implementation and data quality assurance. IPA’s data management system (DMS) provides Excel- and Stata-based resources to handle data quality checks. The DMS is required for all IPA projects. It provides information on data quality and will resolve duplicates before data cleaning begins, among many other features."

Working with SQL databases and other data management software provides additional challenges as data fields may change definitions over time and data structure may not be easily amenable to transfer or import into statistical software such as Stata or R.\nThere is no one-size fits all process to manage administrative data, but automating importing and restructuring, as well as checking data quality are common challenges analysts often face before what we commonly think of cleaning begins. This section provides some information on how to handle these tasks in automatable fashions, as well as ways to think about data storage and unique identification. Other management tasks can be found in the data aggregation section.\nThese problems are exacerbated as data increase in size. Big data requires special data management techniques, especially as data size reaches limitations in statistical software capabilities, processing power, and storage format (Excel, for example, can only store about 1 million observations in .xlsx and 65,000 using .xls). This guide does not cover these challenges in detail, but many resources exist for processing big data in Stata (see NBER and Statalist for tips)."

Importing data into Stata is necessary if the data is not already in Stata format (.dta file). In general, you should be able to use Stata’s functions and loops to efficiently import data. Stata can import most data formats. If your project’s data was collected using a platform like SurveyCTO, the raw data will come in .csv format and the SurveyCTO server will provide a do file that imports the raw .csv data into the Stata .dta format.\n\nImporting different file types\nIn Stata 13 and beyond, the import command can import CSV files, excel files, and more depending on the option used (delimited for CSV, excel for excel), and export does the same for exporting. The import excel and import delimited commands provide a number of options that allow for a large amount of control of importing including from where in the workbook data should be imported from and how data should be saved. See help import for details on these options.\nIf you are new to using import are importing a file type you have not seen before, it can be helpful to use the drop-down menu by clicking “File&gt;Import” and then selecting the appropriate file type. Once you do this, you will be able to copy the specific command syntax directly from the command prompt or review window in Stata to your do-file.\nThe insheet command remains an alternative for .csv, .tsv, and .txt files. It performes differently than import delimited and can be useful for some forms of data, but import delimited should be used preferentially. One thing to note is that it is often a good idea when using the insheet command, to use the option names and have your dataset have the same variable names at those at the top of the raw dataset."

    "text": "Advantages and limitations of WhatsApp Surveys\nAt IPA, we’ve started to rely on WhatsApp as one method for collecting data remotely, driven by its unique strengths that greatly enhance the efficiency and impact of our initiatives. Here are some of the main reasons why we have selected WhatsApp:\nPros\n\nWhatsApp’s massive user base of 2 billion individuals globally ensures that our outreach is extensive and inclusive, covering a diverse range of demographics and geographical regions. This widespread presence enables us to gather insights from different demographic groups. WhatsApp has high engagement levels and widespread familiarity. With people across the globe already using WhatsApp for everyday communication, our surveys seamlessly integrate into their digital routines. This familiarity encourages participation and enables respondents to quickly and conveniently share their perspectives using smartphones, fostering a more accessible and inclusive data collection process.\nWhatsApp is a cost-effective solution that significantly reduces traditional paper, printing, and fieldwork expenses.\nWhatsApp’s capability to handle various types of media, including text, images, audio, and video, enriches our surveys with diverse content, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of respondents’ perspectives.\n\nCons\n\nUser Trust: Users consider WhatsApp a private and secure messaging platform. If they feel that their data is being collected in ways that violate their privacy or trust, it may lead to a negative perception of the organization or business. Therefore, sensitive information should not be asked via WhatsApp.\nOpt-In and Consent Challenges: While obtaining opt-in and consent is crucial for ethical data collection on WhatsApp, researchers need to be mindful of the challenges associated with user trust. Due to existing mistrust with WhatsApp, participants may approach data collection interactions skeptically. Researchers must ensure that participants have a clear option to opt out, and it is essential to obtain explicit upfront consent for these interactions.\nSimplicity of Surveys: Since this is a remote data collection method, questionnaires must be simple. If presented with a complicated survey, participants may have doubts or concerns that no enumerator can help resolve. Therefore, it is advisable to use simple instruments for data collection to minimize attrition and ensure effective participation.",

    "text": "Use of WhatsApp Surveys at IPA Colombia\nData collection in the context of the pandemic posed multiple challenges for researchers. At IPA Colombia, this situation led us to explore and test new tools like WhatsApp surveys.1 Here we’d like to share some of the specific situations in which Whatsapp has been a useful alternative to in-person data collection and some of the lessons we’ve learned in the process.\nOne of the many advantages of using WhatsApp as a tool to contact participants is how versatile it is. It allows for large-scale simultaneous interactions with participants through not only text but also using media files like images, documents, and audio. This facilitates interactions since it offers multiple, friendlier, and demonstrative ways to communicate messages that participants might not have read, or would have been difficult to understand.\n\n\n\nAn example of a WhatsApp Survey\n\n\nThe low cost, effectiveness, and versatility have made it useful for different kinds of projects. For example, this study on the impact of Colombia’s decision to offer legal status to Venezuelan immigrants used WhatsApp surveys on this very mobile population because even if phone numbers change, WhatsApp numbers typically stay stable. This meant we could collect data directly over WhatsApp, but also use it to get their current phone number for follow-up phone surveys.\nProjects such as this entrepreneurship training one, and this one on social protection during COVID-19 used WhatsApp to communicate project information and schedule calls for phone surveys. While another project on teaching socio-emotional skills to young children used WhatsApp surveys as a tool to monitor potential spillovers by tracking whether the control group participants have received resources related to the treatment in-between data collections."

    "text": "Advantages and Limitations\nSimilarly, by allowing the sending of personalized messages, this data collection method may help to create a closer relationship between participants, the projects, and IPA as an organization. For example, in the surveys conducted through WhatsApp in the project with Venezuelan migrants mentioned above, we could personalize messages with names and other information we had, with which we intended to offer a more personal sense of connection. But we might have been too successful and had a slight backfire—it wasn’t obvious to some participants that they were interacting with an automated system, rather than a person, and that led to some frustration. We learned to explain explicitly upfront that the responses they were getting to their answers were automatically generated.\nThere are also some advantages to using a verified WhatsApp business account—we use the IPA logo as our profile picture, which we think cues people to remember who we are when we re-contact them. As we noticed when doing in-person fieldwork with participants who’d been previously contacted through WhatsApp—they seemed to remember IPA from the WhatsApp logo.\nHaving an official account also means the phone number from which messages will be sent is verified. We think this feature helps to increase participant trust—when the number is verified, participants see the organization name in the chat, instead of the number, with a check symbol that certifies the authenticity of the WhatsApp account. We think this in turn may lead to increased response rates. Of course, it doesn’t work the other way—WhatsApp doesn’t confirm a participant’s identity so if we are re-contacting a number we typically recommend including questions to confirm if the person answering on the other end is the person we’re actually trying to reach.\nIf you’ve ever sent a WhatsApp message and waited for the double checkmarks to appear confirming receipt, you know how valuable that information can be. The same is true in the survey process. WhatsApp surveys also allow tracking message receipt and reading. The reports allow us to identify failed deliveries due to a phone number out of service, or without a WhatsApp associated, along with messages that were received and read. This is useful for understanding how well the data collection is going, and for identifying when participants are more difficult to reach. It is worth noting, though, that whether read information is available depends on how the individual has set up their privacy preferences.\nIf you are choosing WhatsApp for data collection, it is worth considering its limitations. First, it is useful with a specific type of population with internet access, smartphones, and some level of technological knowledge, which will limit your sampling to people from specific geographical areas, ages, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This wasn’t an important restriction in the studies described above as most participants had access to WhatsApp and were used to it. It is also difficult to guarantee the quality of the responses for some types of questions, such as multiple selection open-ended questions since there is not an enumerator verifying if the participant fully understood the question. To address this restriction, the projects described above used survey questions that were easy to understand and simple to self-assess.\nEvery data collection medium has advantages and disadvantages, and we are not comparing all options here (we hope to have another post with more technical details and comparisons soon). But for IPA Colombia, particularly during the disruptions of COVID-19, we have found WhatsApp’s versatility a tremendous asset for data collection, despite some small challenges, and the more experience we get, the better we get at using it. If you think it might be useful for your study, we recommend giving it a try."

This section provides detailed guidance on the planning steps that should be undertaken before conducting a focus group.\n\n1. Structure your team\nIdeally, focus group teams should consist of at least two (2) roles: a moderator and a facilitator. The moderator’s primary responsibility is to lead the discussion during the focus group, ensuring that the conversation remains on track and that all participants are engaged. The facilitator handles logistical activities such as setting up recording equipment, providing refreshments and incentives, setting up the space, as well as, taking notes. It is crucial to clearly define and assign these roles in advance to ensure a smooth execution of the focus group.\nIf budget constraints prevent hiring a facilitator, it’s important to recognize that this could negatively impact the quality of the activity and the data collected. Overburdening the moderator with both discussion and logistical duties may compromise their ability to maintain participant focus and engagement. Researchers should be aware of these potential drawbacks when planning qualitative data collection without a dedicated facilitator.\n\n\n2. Understand your field team’s skills\nThe quality of the information produced during qualitative fieldwork is related to the technical skills of the moderator and facilitator leading the activity to collect the information. According to Small and Calarco, certain competencies (described in Table 1 can be identified) allow the teams conducting qualitative data collection to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within the qualitative data. The skills described in Table 1 are acquired, developed, and strengthened through years of study and practice in qualitative methodologies. However, in the context of social program monitoring and evaluation, field teams are often multidisciplinary, with varying levels of experience in qualitative data collection. Whether your team is highly experienced or relatively new to qualitative research, you should study and socialize these skills and think about possible gaps and opportunities for your team to engage with the target population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\nDescription\nRelevance\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect more deeply with participant’s realities and experiences.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process.

Prepare for moderation\nModeration is a fundamental aspect of focus groups. The moderator is responsible for guiding the discussion, ensuring equal participation from all members, and keeping the conversation focused on relevant topics. An effective moderator facilitates a smooth and natural discussion, creating an environment where participants feel comfortable and safe to express their opinions openly, without fear of criticism or judgment.\n\n\n4. Plan logistics\nLogistical activities are important to ensure the correct implementation of focus groups. Careful logistical planning will ensure that all the necessary elements are in place to carry out the activities, participants have been scheduled in a timely manner, and all the details surrounding the fieldwork are clear. Implementing a focus group. Based on the experience of conducting qualitative field operations in various contexts, the IPA team has identified several key practices that are essential for the logistical preparation of a focus group:\n\n\n\n5. Study the script\nThe discussion script is a support tool that seeks to guide the conversation during the focus group according to the research objectives. It contains open-ended questions and topics designed to encourage reflection and discussion.

Overburdening the moderator with both discussion and logistical duties may compromise their ability to maintain participant focus and engagement. Researchers should be aware of these potential drawbacks when planning qualitative data collection without a dedicated facilitator.\n\n\n2. Understanding the Desirable Skills of the Field Team\nThe quality of data produced during qualitative research activities is closely related to the skills of the moderator and facilitator. These competencies, outlined in Table 1, enable teams to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within qualitative data.\nWhile these skills are typically developed through years of study and practice, field teams often consist of individuals from multidisciplinary backgrounds with varying levels of experience. Regardless of experience level, it is important to review and discuss these skills with your team to identify possible gaps and opportunities for improvement.\nCurrently, there are no standardized metrics to measure the prevalence of these skills among qualitative fieldwork moderators. Therefore, the skills in Table 1 should be viewed as a resource for reference and reflection for teams.\nEnsuring that everyone on the team understands how these competencies contribute to effectively engaging with the population is essential for collecting high-quality information.\n\nTable 1: Desirable skills in the field team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\nDescription\nWhy is this skill important?\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect more deeply with participant’s realities and experiences. Helps to create a relationship of trust and respect with the participants. Seeks to avoid generalizations and stereotypes that may arise from preconceptions or external influences such as previous studies. Enhances understanding of participants’ situations without resorting to pity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. Contributes to obtaining deeper responses from participants. Enables exploration of emerging themes during data collection. Helps in detecting and validating patterns observed in the field.\n\n\nSelf-awareness and reflexivity\nThe field team’s ability to continuously reflect on how their presence, background, and assumptions influence data collection, interpretation, and analysis. This ongoing self-reflection ensures that the qualitative field team is mindful of its impact on the research process and the participants.\nHelps maintain ethics in the researcher-participant relationship. Facilitates understanding of personal limitations in connecting with participants. Aids in developing strategies to overcome communication barriers and create an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nThe field team’s ability to represent and reflect the diversity within the group being studied. This skill involves recognizing and documenting the differences and variations among individuals or subgroups during qualitative research, typically applied during the data analysis phase.\nContributes to challenging generalized and simplistic patterns. Ensures that data reflect both common and atypical experiences. Demonstrates the field team’s ability to identify, recognize, and document heterogeneity in the population studied.\n\n\nPalpability\nThe field team’s ability to provide detailed descriptions in their field notes or diaries, making the data tangible and clear. This involves avoiding abstract descriptions and, instead, offering vivid accounts that allow the research team to visualize and understand participants’ experiences and contexts.\nThe palpable field notes and diaries are accompanied by textual quotations, images, or other audiovisual resources that show events, situations, and actors that support the research findings. Reliable findings are supported by specific details that clearly depict the events and situations studied. Helps to avoid abstraction in the data, grounding conclusions in concrete evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Plan logistics activities\nLogistical activities are important to ensure the correct implementation of focus groups. Careful logistical planning will ensure that all the necessary elements are in place to carry out the activities, participants have been scheduled in a timely manner, and all the details surrounding the fieldwork are clear.\nBased on the experience of conducting qualitative field operations in various contexts, the IPA team has identified several key practices that are essential for the logistical preparation of a focus group:\n\nFigure 1: Logistical activities for focus groups\n\nThe sequencing of these activities is suggested and may change according to the context in which the focus groups are conducted. Figure 1 excludes logistical activities that the field and research team had to undertake to ensure the feasibility of conducting research activities, such as guaranteeing a space, contacting leaders, purchasing materials, etc. You should make a comprehensive list of the critical aspects to ensure the success of your qualitative data collection at different levels. As the fieldwork approaches, we suggest you consult the issues in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n4. Study the script\nThe discussion script is a support tool that seeks to guide the conversation during the focus group according to the research objectives. It contains open-ended questions and topics designed to encourage reflection and discussion.\nYou should study the script several times before the activity so that you will be able to explore new topics without losing sight of the objectives of the session. During this process of studying the script, identify:\n\nThe objective of the research activity.\nThe logical order of the focus group guide.\nPossible words or expressions that may confuse the participants so that you have time to change them to more understandable ones.\n\nIf you know in detail the topics to be explored, the script will serve as a reminder during the talk, allowing you to have more flexible and deeper conversations, without losing sight of the research objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe role of the facilitator\n\n\n\nIn addition to understanding the script, the facilitator must also understand the research questions of the project. This will allow them to probe beyond the guide and see, during the execution of the activity, possible questions or dimensions of the problem that were not known when the script was developed.",

How to start the focus group?\n\nIntroduce yourself and clearly explain the role of each member of the work team, and the overall dynamics of the session.\nRead the informed consent, ensuring all participants clearly understand the purpose of the activity and the potential risks and benefits of their participation. During this process, emphasize the confidentiality and anonymity of the information collected during the focus group. The moderator should explicitly obtain the participants’ authorization to record the session.\nThroughout the activity, create a comfortable and calm environment that allows participants to express their opinions spontaneously and without censorship.\nTo maintain a favorable atmosphere, show interest, cordiality, and respect for all interventions, having an attitude of curiosity, even when the topics are extended or the opinions expressed differ from yours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator’s role in this phase\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the recording equipment is working properly throughout the activity.\nTake comprehensive notes on the entire activity, particularly focusing on participants’ interactions and nonverbal reactions.\nEnsure that the seating arrangement of the participants is appropriate for effective communication.\nProvide logistical support to the moderator by delivering refreshments and incentives (if applicable) and attending to the specific needs of participants, such as assisting visually impaired individuals or accommodating participants with children.\nSupport the moderator in managing the session’s timing.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. How to be an effective moderator?5\nModeration is a fundamental aspect of focus groups. The moderator is responsible for guiding the discussion, ensuring equal participation from all members, and keeping the conversation focused on relevant topics. An effective moderator facilitates a smooth and natural discussion, creating an environment where participants feel comfortable and safe to express their opinions openly, without fear of criticism or judgment.\nThis role also involves managing complex and potentially challenging group dynamics, ensuring that all participants have equal opportunities to contribute, and preventing any one participant from dominating the conversation.\n\nTable 2: Basic principles in focus group moderation6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nShow interest in participants (Cognitive empathy)\nAs a moderator, it’s important to show respect and genuine interest in each participant’s contributions. Recognize that everyone has valuable knowledge, regardless of their education level, experience or background. 💡Acknowledge contributions with expressions such as “Thank you for sharing that” or “That’s a very interesting point.” 💡 Address participants by their first name or their chosen pseudonym.\n\n\nAvoid assumptions (Follow-up and heterogeneity)\nDo not assume that the concepts or ideas expressed by the participants are obvious. Avoid taking for granted the meaning of any idea, concept, or expression. 💡For example: In a focus group with Venezuelan migrants, the expression “chamo” comes up. If you do not know this word, you should ask the participants directly what they are referring to with that word.\n\n\nGenerate empathy with participants (Cognitive empathy)\nTry to generate an empathetic connection with the focus group attendees, as this will help them feel safe and valued in sharing their emotions and experiences. By creating a non-judgmental environment, participants may feel more comfortable speaking honestly and openly. 💡 Repeat or summarize participants’ comments to show that you understand their perspectives. 💡Be patient. Do not rush the answers. Allow participants to take their time to think and respond.\n\n\nBe a moderator, not a participant (Reflexivity)\nThe moderator’s role is to guide the conversation, not to be part of it or share personal views. Some moderators assume that sharing personal experiences will encourage a greater exchange of ideas among participants. However, this practice can induce bias and affect the conversation’s overall flow.\n\n\nBe prepared to listen to different opinions and control your reactions (Reflexivity)\nThe moderator is not impartial, no matter how hard he/she tries. It is important to identify your own biases and seek to contain personal assessments of the various opinions that may come from the participants. Avoid making value judgments about the testimonies and responses of the attendees. 💡 It’s important to be mindful of your reactions, as even small responses like nodding or giving short positive feedback such as ‘I think so too’ or ‘You are right’ can inadvertently influence the discussion. These reactions can induce social desirability bias, potentially altering the participants’ responses and the overall dynamics of the discussion.\n\n\nUse your talents (Palpability)\nIdentify your talents and use those that build trust and encourage conversation among participants. 💡Make a list of your skills and talents. Think about what you do well and how these talents can be useful in the context of a focus group.\n\n\nAsk follow-up questions (Follow-up)\nAsking follow-up questions allows for a deeper exploration of participant’s responses. This is essential to understand not only what people think, but why they think the way they do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Possible challenges\n\nTable 3: Considerations and challenges in face-to-face focus groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\nEmotional overflow from participants\nManaging emotions can be one of the most complex challenges during a focus group, especially when discussions touch on intense or personal topics.\nAllow participants to express their emotions, but guide them constructively. Ask how they feel and why, and look for ways to channel those emotions into the discussion. If a person is emotionally affected by an event, ask them if they wish to continue the activity and remind them that participation is voluntary. If emotions disrupt the session, take a short break and show understanding and support. In accordance with research protocols, provide relevant mental health care resources that may be useful for the participants. If the issues to be addressed during the focus group sessions are sensitive, it is desirable for the field team to have a course or training on psychological first aid.\n\n\nResistance to recording\nSome participants may not agree with the recording of their testimonies. If this happens, take into account the following recommendations.\nEmphasize confidentiality, anonymity, and privacy of the data. Remind participants that during the analysis of the information, no personal data of any participant will be added. If you do not obtain authorization to record the session, take notes on topics of conversation, interactions between participants, and other relevant data.\n\n\nConversation diversion\nWhile deviations from the central theme can sometimes provide valuable insights, it’s necessary to steer the conversation back to the research objectives when it strays too far.\nDuring the participants’ interventions, ask follow-up questions that allow you to close the ideas and/or redirect them to the research objectives.\n\n\nParticipants trying to dominate the conversation\nOccasionally, some participants may attempt to dominate the discussion, overshadowing more reserved participants.\nSet ground rules at the start of the session regarding the length of contributions. Identify strategies for asking participants to close their ideas when they are too long. For example, you can use an eye-catching object like a signaling paddle to get participants to finish their contributions.\n\n\nParticipants who are shy or reluctant to participate\nSome participants are too shy to participate or are pushed aside by those who seek to dominate the conversation. In these cases, you must control the situation so everyone can join the conversation.\nUse “icebreaker” activities at the beginning of the session in which everyone participates. Directly address less active attendees with open-ended questions that encourage them to express their thoughts.\n\n\nPolarization of the conversation\nSome topics may have one side polarization on the group discussion, leading to an “excessive consensus” where some participants may hesitate to contradict the dominant view on certain topics. This can limit the diversity of perspectives and affect data quality.\nEmphasize that all viewpoints are valuable and that there are no right or wrong answers. Divide the group into smaller subgroups to discuss certain topics, then reconvene to share different perspectives. Limit speaking time to prevent any one participant from monopolizing the discussion. If the conversation becomes hostile, remind the group of the activity’s purpose and, if necessary, pause the session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Possible errors during moderation\nWhen conducting focus groups, it is important to avoid common mistakes that can compromise the effectiveness of the session and the quality of the collected data. Some of the most critical mistakes are described here:\n\nFigure 2: Common mistakes made when conducting focus groups",

    "text": "After the focus group\nThe focus group session ends when all research topics have been covered and no new data or relevant information is obtained; the research objectives have been achieved, collecting the quantity and quality of data needed to answer the research questions, or when time and resources have reached their limits. To close the work session, it is recommended to (i) offer space for reflection in which participants can express comments, suggestions, or questions about what happened in the focus group; (ii) thank the participants for their time and willingness to participate, emphasizing that the opinions and information provided are of great importance for the study or research being conducted; and (iii) close the data flow, prioritizing the safe storage of the recording of the research activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole of the facilitator in this phase\n\n\n\n\nSupport data flow closure and secure storage of information.\nProvide the notes taken to the moderator.\nEnsure that all equipment used (tape recorders, computers, microphones, etc.) is complete.\n\n\n\n\n1. Document research activities\nAt the end of the focus group, it is important to document the information obtained in detail. How this documentation is done is a decision linked to the research design and is determined before fieldwork begins. Examples of products you can use for this purpose are:\n\nFull transcripts of the discussions\nDetailed notes taken during the research activity\nField notes\nField diaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember: The lack of initial documentation products risks all information processing components and, thus, the quality of the obtained data.\n\n\nInformation should be recorded promptly, as soon as the focus group concludes, to prevent the loss of crucial details. This immediate action is vital to the research process. In addition, the products derived from the focus group must follow information storage protocols, which may include anonymization and encryption to avoid compromising the confidentiality of participants.",

    "text": "Online focus groups\nVirtual focus groups are a viable alternative when in-person sessions are not possible due to factors like distance, time, or budget constraints. While the virtual format shares many characteristics with in-person focus groups, including preparation and moderation activities, it also presents unique challenges that require specific attention.\n\nTable 3: Considerations and challenges in virtual focus groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\nLow interaction\nVirtual settings can reduce interaction due to participants’ inability to read body language and challenges in responding in real time.\nAdapt icebreakers to virtual environments. Use activities that promote group dynamics and interaction. Encourage people to keep their cameras turned on. Try to schedule fewer participants, in order to focus attention on the attendees. Manage short conversational scripts as virtual environments may limit direct communication, which could result in skipping sections and/or questions.\n\n\nConnectivity problems\nConnectivity issues may cause partial or complete interruptions in participants’ involvement.\nValidate participants’ internet connection before scheduling. Provide necessary support, such as data recharges, to ensure participation. Avoid imposing any costs on participants for participating.\n\n\nLack of knowledge of the video call platform\nSome participants may struggle with connecting to and navigating the chosen platform due to unfamiliarity with digital tools.\nDuring the scheduling, offer training on how to use the platform on which the activity will be carried out, for those who need assistance.\n\n\nLack of privacy\nSome participants may take the video call in shared spaces. This situation may place participants in uncomfortable or risky situations, depending on the sensitivity of the topics.\nDuring the scheduling, ask the participants directly:  i) where they will take the interview  ii) who might listen to you  iii) if they feel safe having the interview under these conditions.  Based on the above, assess whether it is convenient for certain people to participate in the study under these conditions. If people cannot find a private space and sensitive or confidential topics are handled, we recommend not including that participant in the focus group. And evaluate interviewing this person in a different setting.\n\n\nDistractions and lack of focus\nParticipants may be distracted by other duties or social media during the session, affecting their concentration and participation.\nSuggest that people have their cameras turned on. Emphasize the need for full attention and engagement during the session.\n\n\nFatigue due to constant use of screens\nProlonged screen time can lead to fatigue, affecting the focus and energy of both moderators and participants.\nSchedule breaks during long sessions. Limit the duration of each session to a reasonable time, approximately one (1) hour. Plan multiple sessions if needed.\n\n\n\nThis practical guide offers essential tools for conducting qualitative fieldwork through focus groups. However, it’s important to remember that data collection is just the beginning. After gathering data through focus groups, the next step is to analyze the information. This analysis is crucial for interpreting the results, identifying patterns, themes, and meanings, and ultimately enriching qualitative research.\nLast updated December 2024.",

    "text": "Planning a focus group\nProper preparation is essential for the success of focus groups, ensuring that the research activity meets its field data collection objectives. This section provides detailed guidance on the planning steps that should be undertaken before conducting a focus group.\n\n1. Structure your team\nIdeally, focus group teams should consist of at least two (2) roles: a moderator and a facilitator. The moderator’s primary responsibility is to lead the discussion during the focus group, ensuring that the conversation remains on track and that all participants are engaged. The facilitator handles logistical activities such as setting up recording equipment, providing refreshments and incentives, setting up the space, as well as, taking notes. It is crucial to clearly define and assign these roles in advance to ensure a smooth execution of the focus group.\nIf budget constraints prevent hiring a facilitator, it’s important to recognize that this could negatively impact the quality of the activity and the data collected. Overburdening the moderator with both discussion and logistical duties may compromise their ability to maintain participant focus and engagement. Researchers should be aware of these potential drawbacks when planning qualitative data collection without a dedicated facilitator.\n\n\n2. Understand your field team’s skills\nThe quality of the information produced during qualitative fieldwork is related to the technical skills of the moderator and facilitator leading the activity to collect the information. According to Small and Calarco, certain competencies (described in Table 1 can be identified) allow the teams conducting qualitative data collection to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within the qualitative data. The skills described in Table 1 are acquired, developed, and strengthened through years of study and practice in qualitative methodologies. However, in the context of social program monitoring and evaluation, field teams are often multidisciplinary, with varying levels of experience in qualitative data collection. Whether your team is highly experienced or relatively new to qualitative research, you should study and socialize these skills and think about possible gaps and opportunities for your team to engage with the target population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\nDescription\nRelevance\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect more deeply with participant’s realities and experiences.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Prepare for moderation\nModeration is a fundamental aspect of focus groups. The moderator is responsible for guiding the discussion, ensuring equal participation from all members, and keeping the conversation focused on relevant topics. An effective moderator facilitates a smooth and natural discussion, creating an environment where participants feel comfortable and safe to express their opinions openly, without fear of criticism or judgment.\n\n\n4. Plan logistics\nLogistical activities are important to ensure the correct implementation of focus groups. Careful logistical planning will ensure that all the necessary elements are in place to carry out the activities, participants have been scheduled in a timely manner, and all the details surrounding the fieldwork are clear.

Based on the experience of conducting qualitative field operations in various contexts, the IPA team has identified several key practices that are essential for the logistical preparation of a focus group:\n\n\n\n5. Study the script\nThe discussion script is a support tool that seeks to guide the conversation during the focus group according to the research objectives. It contains open-ended questions and topics designed to encourage reflection and discussion. You should study the script several times before the activity so that you will be able to explore new topics without losing sight of the objectives of the session. During this process of studying the script, identify:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe role of the facilitator\n\n\n\nIn addition to understanding the script, the facilitator must also understand the research questions of the project. This will allow them to probe beyond the guide and see, during the execution of the activity, possible questions or dimensions of the problem that were not known when the script was developed."

    "text": "What is Twilio?\nTwilio is an interactive platform with customers. This platform allows communication through calls, text, email, video, and WhatsApp. Due to its flexibility, it has been used in IPA Colombia as a tool to send WhatsApp messages and implement WhatsApp surveys. Given the number of available tools, it is flexible to adapt to the different needs of a project.\n\nTwilio offers the following services:\nWhatsApp surveys\nWhatsApp chatbots\nSMS surveys\nInteractive Voice Response surveys (IVR)\nMassive email campaigns\nCustomer support/assistance, virtual call center by WhatsApp, voice and video calls\n\nWhat is Twilio’s role to implement WhatsApp surveys? Twilio offers an API (Application Programming Interface) integration that allows developers to use Twilio to send and receive messages on the WhatsApp platform. Businesses and developers can leverage Twilio to integrate WhatsApp messaging capabilities into their applications or systems, enabling communication with users via WhatsApp. Twilio is an intermediary that facilitates communication between the application and WhatsApp, making it easier for developers to incorporate WhatsApp messaging into their solutions. For the IPA case, Twilio facilitates the development of WhatsApp Surveys and data collection.\nSome main concepts that will help us get familiarized with Twilio include: * Twilio Console: is the centralized interface where users manage and control various Twilio services. It is the primary dashboard for configuring, monitoring and optimizing communication functionalities. * WhatsApp Functionality: refers to the enhanced communication capabilities unlocked by upgrading a Twilio account. This includes leveraging WhatsApp for surveys and other interactive communication. * WhatsApp Sender Management: Within the Twilio Console, users manage WhatsApp senders through the “Messaging” section. This functionality provides oversight and control over sender-related activities. * API Access Request: Users can create new senders within the Twilio Console, request access to the WhatsApp API, and submit necessary information for approval. This process enables integration with WhatsApp services."

These modifications are called cleaning. The cleaning process should always be reproducible, well documented, and defensive – the code should tell the user if the data isn’t as expected.\nThis guide outlines best practices in data cleaning, primarily concentrating on converting raw survey data to usable data for analysis of RCTs using Stata. The scope of the guide is to cover the principles of cleaning data over a project lifecycle with the goal of producing clean data in an accurate and reproducible fashion. The guide does not cover best practices in designing surveys, coding, or conducting data analysis.\nIn each section, we describe a set of common tasks and provide information on “what” this step is and “how” we suggest this step is completed in Stata. We also flag potential complexities. This guide assumes basic knowledge of Stata (introductory Stata training can be found here).\nAs part of this guide, we briefly cover other parts of the data flow, including coding best practices, deidentification, and version control. In many ways these topics are distinct from data cleaning, but all interrelate to some extent. Effective data cleaning will follow coding best practices, have a version control system, and be well documented.",

    "text": "Data flow\nAt a high-level, the process that data goes through from when it is generated, in a survey or from an automated banking systems, is a transition from a format that reflects the structure of what is collecting the data to a structure that can be used for analyzing the information. The contents of the data do not change during this process, but the format in which they’re stored, aggregated, and labeled do.\nThis entire process is called a data flow. At GPRL and IPA, we think of the steps in the data flow that take place in statistical software in the four steps below. It is worth noting that differences in the data may make it impossible to follow this order exactly. Generally, deidentification should happen as soon as possible in the data flow if the data contains PII:\n\n\n\nData Flow Process\n\n\n\n\nImport data – all collected data is combined into a format readable by statistical software. In this step, the raw data is imported, corrections from enumerators are applied, and duplicates observations are removed.\nDeidentify data – personally identifying information (PII) is removed. This includes all individually identifying PII (geographic information, names, addresses, enumerator comments, etc.), as well as group identifying information (a combination of village and birthdate for example).\nClean data – data content, formats, and encoding is standardized. After this, data consistency is verified and similar datasets are appended to create single datasets used to create outcomes.\nCreate outcomes – individual outcome variables are created from the clean data. Data are merged and appended as part of this project to make a dataset at the level of analysis needed.",

    "section": "Data cleaning",
    "text": "Data cleaning\nIt goes without saying that raw data cannot be used for analysis. Individual survey items will not be informative on their own in most cases. Outcome variables need to be created from standardized sets of variables. In addition, documentation needs to be added so users of the data are clear on what each dataset contains.\nRaw data often needs corrections and deduplication that often requires additional data from enumerators or respondents. We view data collection for replacement as part of the data collection process. Often, these replacements are collected and made as part of the monitoring process. IPA and GPRL produced many tools and resources to help this process. In particular, IPA’s Data Management System supports data quality monitoring, duplicate management, and corrections.\nOnce data is in a format to be imported, the raw data will have its own idiosyncrasies. The cleaning process attempts to standardize these idiosyncrasies in a reproducible way. Imagine you have three surveys each with slightly different outputs. Cleaning would make the output from those datasets equivalent in format, and standardized modifications made to the content. The code that produces those data should be able to be run any number of times and should tell the user if something about the data has changed so that it can’t accomplish its function.\nWe find it useful to think about the cleaning processing in four rough stage:\n\nRaw Survey Data Management\nVariable Management\nDataset, Value, and Variable Documentation\nData Aggregation\n\nEach of these stages has a description in the guide, as well as a list of tasks which each has a subpage in the guide. In addition, this guide briefly touches on Stata coding practices relevant to this process, as well as some tasks related to outcome creation that require data management and are particularly prone to error in Stata.",

    "text": "Absolute vs. Relative Paths\nWhen working with Stata, it is important to keep a good file system that allows you to easily find project files and subfolders that you may be looking for. Sometimes you may be working alone and can set all your paths with only your own workspace in mind. However, in most cases you will want to write your Stata code in a way that makes it easily usable on other computers without additional setup.\nA relative path denotes a file path in relation to the current working directory, while an absolute path denotes a file’s path at a fixed location on a disk. In most cases, you want to use relative paths—let’s explore how they work. First, examine the folder shown below. Take notice of the path at the top as well as the subfolders in this folder.\n\n\n\nAbsolute vs. Relative Paths in Stata\n\n\nLet’s assume that your current working directory in Stata is “D:CleaningData”, which is the folder in the picture above. You want to navigate within Stata to the “1 dofiles” subfolder. You could achieve this using either of the following codes:\n* Option 1\ncd \"D:\\Files\\Data Cleaning\\Main Data/1 dofiles\"\n\n* Option 2\ncd \"1 dofiles\"\nCode 1 is an example of using an absolute path—it directs Stata to an exact location every single time you run this code. This means that regardless of your current working directory in Stata, you can always switch to this target directory using Code 1. However, this code may not work on another computer unless the other user has the “Main Data” folder located in the path “D:Cleaning”.\nCode 2 directs Stata to the same folder using a relative path. Based on this code, Stata will assume that you want to move to a folder named “1 dofiles” which is located in your current working directory. This code will only work if your current working directory contains the folder “1 dofiles”.",

The .dta format is the primary format you will use when storing and analyzing data in Stata.\nThere are several ways to import a dataset into Stata, including:\n\nThe “use” command\nUsing File &gt; Open in the menu bar to select a file\nClicking on the “Open” icon (which looks like a folder) in the Menu bar to select a file.\nDouble clicking on the dataset within your computer’s file directory to open a new Stata session with the dataset already loaded\n\nIn most applications, we should be using the “use” command. For example, let’s download a sample dataset into our current working directory using this command:\ncopy \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PovertyAction/IPA-Stata-Trainings/master/Stata%20101/Data/intro.dta\" \"intro.dta\", replace\nNote that you will not see a change in your Stata display after running this command. If you open the folder that you have designated as the current working directory, you should now see a .dta file (marked with the Stata icon) titled “intro.”\nNext, let’s import this dataset from our current working directory into Stata. To do this, use the “use” command to import the dataset “intro.dta” as follows:\nuse \"intro.dta\", clear\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nBecause the file is located in your current working directory, you do not need to specify the file path.\nIf you already have a different dataset loaded in Stata’s memory, you will need to include the “, clear” option as part of your command.\n\n\n\nThe “use” command also works directly with URLs. Let’s re-import our “intro” dataset straight from the Github website by running the following code in Stata:\nuse \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PovertyAction/IPA-Stata-Trainings/master/Stata%20101/Data/intro.dta\", clear\nYou will see that Stata has automatically detected and imported the dataset directly from the website without you needing to download it first.",

    "section": "What are qualitative interviews?",
    "text": "What are qualitative interviews?\nAn interview is a qualitative method of gathering information through a formal dialogue between two people—the interviewer and the interviewee—guided by a specific research goal. Unlike conventional conversations, which involve symmetrical communication and relationship (with no person guiding the conversation) between the interlocutors1, a qualitative interview is based on a structured approach. In this setting, the interviewee permits the interviewer to direct the conversation and guide the dialogue in accordance with the objectives of the study. The interviewee thus becomes the primary source of information.2\nThis collection method is characterized by its flexibility. While there is a script or a list of specific topics to investigate, the interviewer may follow emerging topics or delve deeper into particular aspects according to the interviewee’s answers.\nThe structure of this data collection technique can vary widely. At one end of the spectrum are highly structured interviews, which follow a defined sequence of topics and number of questions. At the other end are semi-structured interviews, where the moderator intuitively delves into the topics of interest.3 The structure of the interview is influenced by the research objectives and the type of data to be obtained.\nIn-depth interviews help to learn about the interviewees’ feelings, opinions, perspectives, beliefs, and experiences. The interviewees express themselves in their own words and in an active way, pointing out their point of view on the issues raised by the interviewer.\nThis collection method is appropriate for discussing complex or sensitive topics that some people may be reluctant to discuss in a group setting.4 Qualitative interviews provide unique insights from participants’ experiences and knowledge, translated into detailed narratives and descriptions that reveal how people interpret their experiences and the world around them.\nQualitative interviews seek in-depth answers and the person’s interpretive perspective. In general, interviews have some advantages for certain profiles in contrast to focus groups such as:\n\nExperts in different fields\nPopulations that experienced traumatic events\nPersons deprived of liberty\nGeographically dispersed populations\nPeople with disabilities\n\nTypes of Data to be Collected:\n\nFeelings and Emotions: Understanding the emotional responses and feelings of the interviewee.\nOpinions and Perspectives: Gaining insights into the interviewee’s viewpoints and beliefs.\nExperiences and Narratives: Collecting detailed accounts of the interviewee’s personal experiences.\nKnowledge and Expertise: Gathering information from experts or individuals with specialized knowledge.",

    "text": "Planning a qualitative interview\nProper preparation is essential for the success of an interview, ensuring that the research activity meets its field data collection objectives. This section provides detailed guidance on the planning steps that should be undertaken before conducting an interview.\n\n1. Structure your team\nDuring qualitative interviews, the fieldwork team is composed of a moderator and a facilitator. The facilitator’s participation is crucial to support logistical and note-taking processes. While budget restrictions may sometimes require the moderator to work individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you should not have a facilitator\n\n\n\nWhen an interview involves sensitive or personal issues, such as when the interviewee is hesitant to share intimate details, the interviewer’s approach can significantly impact the conversation. For example, if a facilitator does not value the importance of mental health, this may become evident in how they take notes during an interview about traumatic experiences related to mental health.\n\n\nIf you have a facilitator, it is important that you identify the functions they will perform.\n\n\n2. Understanding the Desirable Skills of the Field Team\nThe quality of data produced during qualitative research activities is closely related to the skills of the moderator and facilitator.5 These competencies, outlined in Table 1, enable teams to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within qualitative data.6\nWhile these skills are typically developed through years of study and practice, field teams often consist of individuals from multidisciplinary backgrounds with varying levels of experience. Regardless of experience level, it is important to review and discuss these skills with your team to identify possible gaps and opportunities for improvement.\nCurrently, there are no standardized metrics to measure the prevalence of these skills among qualitative fieldwork moderators. Therefore, the skills in Table 1 should be viewed as a resource for reference and reflection for teams.\nEnsuring that everyone on the team understands how these competencies contribute to effectively engaging with the population is essential for collecting high-quality information.\n\nTable 1: Desirable skills in the field team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\nDescription\nWhy is this skill important?\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect more deeply with participant’s realities and experiences. Helps to create a relationship of trust and respect with the participants. Seeks to avoid generalizations and stereotypes that may arise from preconceptions or external influences such as previous studies. Enhances understanding of participants’ situations without resorting to pity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. Contributes to obtaining deeper responses from participants. Enables exploration of emerging themes during data collection. Helps detect and validate patterns observed in the field.\n\n\nSelf-awareness and reflexivity\nThe field team’s ability to continuously reflect on how their presence, background, and assumptions influence data collection, interpretation, and analysis. This ongoing self-reflection ensures that the qualitative field team is mindful of its impact on the research process and the participants.\nHelps maintain ethics in the researcher-participant relationship. Facilitates understanding of personal limitations in connecting with participants. Aids in developing strategies to overcome communication barriers and create an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nThe field team’s ability to represent and reflect the diversity within the group being studied. This skill involves recognizing and documenting the differences and variations among individuals or subgroups during qualitative research, typically applied during the data analysis phase.\nContributes to challenging generalized and simplistic patterns. Ensures that data reflect both common and atypical experiences. Demonstrates the field team’s ability to identify, recognize, and document heterogeneity in the population studied.\n\n\nPalpability\nThe field team’s ability to provide detailed descriptions in their field notes or diaries, making the data tangible and clear. This involves avoiding abstract descriptions and, instead, offering vivid accounts that allow the research team to visualize and understand participants’ experiences and contexts.\nReliable findings are supported by specific details that clearly depict the events and situations studied. Helps to avoid abstraction in the data, grounding conclusions in concrete evidence.\n\n\n\nThese skills may seem abstract and complex. In Table 2 are described specific tasks that you can implement during data collection that will help you cultivate the skills described above.\n\n\n\n3. Plan logistics activities\nLogistical activities play a crucial role in the success of interviews. Careful planning ensures that all necessary elements are in place to conduct interviews smoothly.\nBased on our experience in qualitative field operations across various contexts, the IPA team has identified key practices that guide research teams in effective planning:\n\nFigure 1: Logistical activities for interviews\n\nFigure 1 presents general activities that should happen before implementing interviews. However, this list could be more comprehensive based on the specific research needs of the field work. Ensure you cover all critical aspects to complete your research activities successfully.\n\n\n\n4. Study the script\nUnderstanding the research questions is crucial for effective interviewing. The script is a guiding tool that helps keep the conversation within the research objectives. However, each dialogue is unique, so it’s important to study the script thoroughly to adapt to the conversation’s context without losing sight of the main topics.\nDuring the script preparation, you should identify the main questions to address the research objectives and strategically use follow-up and probing questions to delve deeper into relevant issues7:\n\nMain questions: These are the questions that guide the interview. They are defined beforehand and specified in the script.\nFollow-up questions: These are used to obtain more details and depth on specific topics, concepts, or events mentioned by the person being interviewed.\n\nWhat do you think would happen if…?\nCould you give me an example of…?\nHow did you decide to do it…?\nHow did you determine what was important…?\nHow did you conclude what you are telling me…?\n\nProbing questions: They help validate what the participant is saying was understood and also encourage the dynamic flow throughout the conversation.\n\nIs this what you said…?\nDid I understand you when you said…?\nWhat is another way you could…?\nDid I paraphrase accurately what you said?\n\n\nThis will allow you to obtain the essential information directly related to the study’s objectives and explore additional areas that can provide context and enrich the understanding of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember:\n\n\n\nIt is important to understand the research goals and main questions. It will allow you to go beyond the questionnaire and approach questions or dimensions of the problem that were not initially known.",

How to start an interview?\n\nIntroduce yourself and explain the activity’s objective and the session’s dynamics.\n\n\nTo begin the interview, introduce yourself and explain the activity’s objective and the session’s dynamics.\n\n\nRead the informed consent form.\n\n\nEnsure that the interviewee understands the purpose of the activity, its confidentiality, and the potential risks and benefits of participating in it. Use simple words that the interviewee understands.\n\n\nEmphasize data security strategies.\n\n\nYou should also emphasize the data security strategies that your organization and you as a researcher have in place to keep it confidential. This will help the interviewee feel confident that they can freely discuss their experiences and will be heard.\n\n\nCreate a comfortable and calm atmosphere.\n\n\nThroughout the activity, it is essential to create a comfortable and calm atmosphere that allows the interviewee’s opinions to be spontaneous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole of the facilitator in this phase\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that recording equipment is working properly throughout the activity.\nAsk counter-questions to the interviewee.\nVerify that no relevant topics are left out.\nAssist if the interviewee’s emotions prevent them from continuing with the interview. For example, in actions such as offering a glass of water or proposing a pause.\nTake notes of the entire activity, especially the interviewee’s nonverbal reactions.\nSupport the moderator in time management.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. How to be an effective interviewer?\nModeration is a fundamental element in interviews. The interviewer guides the discussion and ensures the flow of the dialogue with the interviewee while focusing on the relevant issues.\nAn effective moderator not only facilitates a smooth and natural discussion but also creates an environment where the participant feels comfortable and safe expressing their opinions openly, without fear of criticism or judgment.\n\nTable 2: Key Skills for an Interviewer8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nProvide for participants’ well-being  (Cognitive empathy)\nEstablishing a safe and comfortable environment for participants is essential. Prioritize the well-being of the interviewee and ensure that they feel respected and valued. At the same time, the interview environment and rhythm should be adapted to reduce stress or discomfort for the interviewee. 💡Focus on using body language that promotes trust with the person you are interviewing.\n\n\nBe empathetic  (Cognitive empathy)\nExpress empathy during the interview. Understanding and validating the interviewee’s emotions will help you create an atmosphere of openness and sincerity. Effective communication can help the interview to run smoothly. 💡Express gratitude for the interviewee’s time and openness. Phrases such as “Thank you for sharing that with me” or “I really appreciate your sincerity” can help create an atmosphere of trust. 💡Align your facial expression and tone of voice with the interviewee’s emotions. For example, if someone expresses sadness, show a sympathetic expression; if someone is excited, reflect enthusiasm.\n\n\nUse few interruptions  (Cognitive empathy and monitoring)\nAvoid interrupting the interviewee abruptly. Instead guide the conversation back if it strays. Remember that the main source of information is the interviewee, whose ideas establish the narrative order, even if there are already predetermined topics. 💡This recommendation may have exceptions. If an interviewee goes on too long, changes the objective of the question abruptly, or wanders away from the questions posed, you can pick up the conversation with subtlety. One strategy is to repeat the last thing the interviewee said and use it as a preamble to a question. Another alternative is to ask more frequent counter-questions, encouraging the interviewee to close their ideas.\n\n\nListen actively to the interviewee  (Tracking and heterogeneity)\nShow interest and full attention when listening. This involves hearing what the interviewee says, thinking about why they say it, and observing their body language. Try to ask thoughtful questions. 💡Frequently, paraphrase or summarize what the interviewee has said to confirm that you understood correctly, and if required elaborate further on the answer. 💡Maintain eye contact in a natural and relaxed manner. This shows that you focus on the person and what they say.\n\n\nAvoid value judgments  (Reflexivity)\nThe interviewer position should be to inquire, remaining neutral. Avoid acting with judgment who can influence the interviewee’s response. 💡It is important to avoid validating phrases such as “I agree with you.” Instead, it is expected to look for neutral expressions that encourage deepening the dialogue, such as “I understand you” or “Could you elaborate further?”\n\n\nTrain your memory  (Follow-up)\nWork on your ability to remember key details. This will allow you to make meaningful connections and counter-questions during the conversation, giving you more control and enriching the quality of the dialogue. 💡Take notes of keywords or events the interviewee narrates so you can return to these topics and paraphrase what is mentioned or ask counter-questions.\n\n\nUse silences positively  (Follow-up)\nLearn to handle silences constructively. Silence can allow the interviewee time to think and respond deeply. 💡Avoid crutches. Resist the temptation to fill silence with unnecessary words like “umm” or “well.” Let the interviewee take the initiative to speak when they are ready. 💡Use silence breaks to review and take notes. This shows that you value the interview responses and gives them time to think without feeling constantly observed. 💡Pay attention to the interviewee’s nonverbal cues. If they seem to be thinking deeply, give them more time. You can offer a soft question or affirmation to restart the conversation if they look uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Possible challenges\n\nTable 3: Common Challenges in Conducting Interviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\nIncomplete, superficial or monosyllabic responses\nIn some interviews, particularly at the beginning, the interviewee may be shy or inhibited, which prevents them from providing detailed and in-depth answers to the questions posed.\n💡To identify an incomplete or superficial response, you can look for aspects such as  i. answers that are too general and do not provide specific details  ii. answers that are restricted to one or a few words  iii. haste in answering without going into detail.  Invest time at the beginning of the activity to build rapport with the interviewee before addressing more in-depth questions. This initial trust may encourage fuller responses. You can use “icebreaker” activities to do this. Ask open-ended questions that require a more elaborate response and prepare follow-up questions to provide more details on initial responses. Politely ask for clarification by using counter-questions like “How did you feel about this?” or “What was your reaction when this happened?” to encourage more detailed answers. Explain how your answers make a valuable contribution to the study or project. Ask easy-to-understand questions in simple language and rephrase some if necessary.\n\n\nEmotional overflow from participants\nParticipants may experience intense emotions during an interview, which can be challenging to manage due to the personal nature of discussions.\nBe empathetic and avoid abrupt changes in discussion topics during emotionally charged moments. Allow participants to express their emotions while guiding the discussion constructively. Offer the option to pause or continue based on the participant’s comfort. If emotions are overwhelming, take a short break and show support. Provide relevant mental health care information as per research protocols. Ensure the field team has training in psychological first aid if sensitive issues will be discussed.\n\n\nInterviewee and interviewer fatigue\nFatigue can affect both the interviewee and interviewer, leading to a loss of concentration, energy, and quality in responses. This may result in missed questions or premature assumptions.\nLimit the interview length and be flexible with scheduling if you notice signs of fatigue. Ensure the interview environment is comfortable, with good lighting and low noise. Schedule breaks during the interview if necessary, or continue at another time if needed. Consider active breaks or refreshments to help rejuvenate participants.\n\n\nDeviation from the central theme\nConversations may deviate from the interview’s objectives, requiring the moderator to tactfully redirect the discussion while balancing the exploration of valuable but off-topic insights.\nDirect the conversation subtly and without abruptly interrupting the interviewee to return to the main topic. Establish clear objectives at the beginning. Before starting the interview, explain the objectives and topics to be covered so that the interviewee is clear about the necessary focus.\n\n\nHostile interviewee\nAn interviewee may dominate the conversation with aggressive or derogatory language, creating a tense atmosphere.\nPrepare some key concepts about the topic that can help you respond confidently to the interviewee’s objections or challenges. In the event of verbal or other kind of aggression, politely end the interview, thanking the participant for their time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Common mistakes\nWhen conducting interviews, some mistakes should be avoided so that the research activity, objectives, and the integrity of the person being interviewed are protected. Some mistakes are described here:\n\nFigure 2. Common interviewing errors",

To wrap up the working session, it is recommended to (i) provide space for reflection in which the interviewee can express comments, suggestions, or questions about the discussion; (ii) express gratitude to the participants for their time and willingness to participate, emphasizing the importance of their opinions and the information they provided to the study; (iii) secure the data by prioritizing the safe storage of the recording and notes from the session.\nIt is important to start working on the interview notes as soon as possible once it has been completed because if too much time passes between field activities and developing analysis, there is a risk of accumulating information and losing the opportunity to enrich the study research team insights.\n\n1. Document Research Activities\nAt the end of the interview, it is important to document the information obtained in detail. How this documentation is done is a decision linked to the research design and is determined before fieldwork begins. Examples of products you can use for this purpose are: - Full transcripts of the discussions - Detailed notes taken during the research activity - Field notes - Field diaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember:\n\n\n\nThe lack of initial documentation products risks all information processing components and, thus, the quality of the data obtained.\n\n\nInformation should be recorded promptly, as soon as the interview concludes, to prevent the loss of crucial details. This immediate action is vital to the research process. In addition, the products derived from the focus group must follow information storage protocols, which may include anonymization and encryption to avoid compromising the confidentiality of participants.",

    "text": "Online interviews\nRemote interviews (virtual via a digital platform such as meets, Zoom, or telephone) are an alternative when face-to-face interviews are not feasible due to distance, time, and budget constraints or when the interviewee prefers a remote setting. These interviews are beneficial for connecting participants from distant geographic locations or those who cannot attend in person, while also providing a safe and discreet environment. However, remote settings come with specific challenges that must be considered.\n\nTable 4: Considerations and challenges in virtual interviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\nBuilding trust and empathy\nIn remote interviews it is often more difficult to establish trust.\n💡Invest time in the initial conversation to establish a personal connection. Be verbally expressive and attentive to compensate for the lack of more subtle nonverbal cues. Avoid distractions that may be present. In the case of virtual interviews, ask the participant to use a camera during the activity.\n\n\nConnectivity problems\nConnectivity problems include situations that may cause people to wholly or partially interrupt their participation in the interview.\n💡During the scheduling, validate the participants’ connection difficulties; if they require it, make internet recharges. Avoid that the research activity generates connectivity costs for the participants. If necessary, consider interviewing in person.\n\n\nFatigue due to constant use of screens\nFatigue associated with prolonged screen use or time on the phone can affect the concentration of both the interviewer and the interviewee.\n💡Plan breaks during lengthy interviews. Limit the duration of each session to a reasonable time, approximately one (1) hour. Plan several sessions if necessary.\n\n\nUsers multitasking\nThe person being interviewed may perform other tasks while participating (for example, preparing lunch or attending to someone else). This may affect their participation in the activity.\n💡Suggest that the interviewee have their camera turned on. During scheduling, remember that the interview is an activity that involves full attention to listening to others, and engagement with the questions.\n\n\nConfidentiality\nSome interviewees may carry out the activity in spaces shared with family members and acquaintances. Depending on the sensitivity of the topics, this situation may place participants in uncomfortable or risky situations.\n💡Advise interviewees on how to select an ideal space to have the interview. Inform the participant when the recording starts, pauses or stops.\n\n\n\nThis practical guide provides some tools to conduct qualitative fieldwork through interviews. However, it is essential to note that data collection is one of the first steps in the process. After data collection, a necessary process of analyzing the information collected follows. This analysis allows the results to be interpreted and understood in depth, facilitating the identification of patterns, themes, and meanings crucial for qualitative research.\nLast updated December 2024.",

    "text": "1. What are Rapid Ethnographic Assessments?\nRapid Ethnographic Assessment (REA) is a qualitative research method that allows the agile collection of information for decision-making. This methodology is characterized by several key features:\n\nTable 1: Properties of Rapid Ethnography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\nObjective\n\n\n\n\nConduct participant observations\nTo approach the internal perspective of individuals in specific situations, from everyday life and the researcher’s own experiences during events.\n\n\nUse of field notes\nTo condense the preliminary results from various data collection techniques (e.g., focus groups, interviews, observations, etc.). These field notes include dense descriptions and reflective statements documenting the fieldwork, along with personal reflections.\n\n\nEstablish relationships with the community or participants\nREA is based on the premise that extensive and in-depth information can be obtained through short, intensive, and participatory fieldwork with the community. This participatory aspect ensures active engagement and involvement.\n\n\nSeek social and cultural relationships within a group of people\nREA emphasizes understanding individual daily activities and group’s culture, norms, activities, and social relations. In contrast to classic approaches, it offers a more specific focus, a shorter duration, and limited scope.\n\n\nHolistic approach to the topics studied\nConducting an REA allows the researcher to connect qualitative data collection techniques and other available data sources to rapidly generate insights. These insights are obtained through the researcher’s interpretations. The focus of REA is not objectivity but the identification of high-quality relationships among people, stories, and events mapped in the field.\n\n\n\nThese principles have their roots in classical ethnography, which aims to understand a problem or situation from the “insider’s” or “subject’s perspective”. Unlike classical ethnographies that involve extensive time (potentially months or years) in the field, Rapid Ethnographic Assessments (REA) are executed in a short period of time and seek to inform decision-makers in a timely manner. Some authors have suggested that REA should be conducted over four to six weeks.\nWith rapid ethnographies, information can be collected mainly through qualitative techniques, such as interviews, focus groups, and observations. However, quantitative techniques, such as available data and short surveys, can also be used to support the answer to the research questions.\nTo achieve relevant insights, REAs are characterized by the triangulation of results, the consolidation of multidisciplinary teams, and iterative learning processes. Combining multiple techniques positions rapid ethnography as a tool that provides findings and recommendations based on detailed, culturally relevant information reflecting local realities.\n\n\n1.1 When is it useful to conduct a rapid ethnography?\nREAs are particularly useful when practical and actionable recommendations are needed quickly. While this methodology has great potential, the rapid collection and processing mean that REA findings are exploratory. Their scope is limited to identifying findings from particular contexts rather than generating generalizable knowledge. In this sense, REA is especially useful when:\n\nMore information is needed about an emerging problem or situation with little existing knowledge: Rapid ethnographies can provide descriptive information about poorly understood problems, helping to identify causes and design appropriate interventions.\nEngagement with “hidden” or vulnerable populations is necessary: Some populations may be particularly closed and difficult to reach. Accessing these groups requires the support of trusted individuals within the community. Rapid ethnographies often seek to identify and involve these community leaders to facilitate contact and build trust during the research.\nCommunity involvement is essential: Understanding how to address a problem requires the involvement of local community members. Involving the people who are directly affected by a problem often results in more practical and achievable recommendations for the program or intervention.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Examples of Uses of Rapid Ethnographies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Uses of REA\n\n\n\n\nPublic Health: After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans experienced a demographic increase in the Latino population, particularly among single, undocumented men. Researchers suspected an emerging pattern of crack use among this population but needed more information to formulate responses. The REA results revealed how contextual factors such as a growing drug market, coupled with social isolation and victimization of the undocumented Latino population, led to the initiation and increase in crack use among a group that previously had relatively low drug use.\n\n\nMigration: Accessing the migrant and refugee vulnerable population is a challenge due to factors such as stigmatization of the population due to lack of regular migratory status, lack of documentation, and distrust towards state institutions. Rapid ethnographies allowed for strategic approaches with community leaders and migrant organizations within local communities. Their involvement was fundamental in building trust in the community and accessing the target population, making them feel included and valued in the process.\n\n\nEmergency Contexts: Between November 2020 and January 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers conducted a REA in Dhaka, Bangladesh. They used in-depth interviews and participant observations to explore their health-related beliefs and practices. REA revealed a gap between scientific explanations of COVID-19 and the community’s cultural and spiritual beliefs, such as the perception of the virus as a disease of the rich and sinners, leading many to reject biosecurity measures. These findings highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of community perceptions to improve the effectiveness of public health policies.",

    "section": "2. What Kind of Information is Obtained?",
    "text": "2. What Kind of Information is Obtained?\nThe data produced during REA is gathered through a combination of various data collection techniques. The information and resources obtained from these techniques can be presented in a variety of formats. This interactive process involves the use of audio recordings from interviews and focus groups; photographs and videos taken during observation activities; texts resulting from note-taking during activities; and other resources such as maps or drawings that can be provided by the community. The mechanism of interaction between resources and the process on how that information contributes to generate insights depends on the scope of research questions and the strategy designed by the researcher to address rich information with time constraints.\n\n2.1 How to Prepare?\nPreparing for the conduct of a rapid ethnography involves i) identifying the methodological relevance to respond to the research objectives and questions; ii) carrying out logistical planning for the development of activities; iii) structuring the field team for the collection; and iv) designing a data reception plan that facilitates the triangulation of the information collected.\n\n2.1.1 Identify the Relevance of the Methodology and Design the Collection Instruments\n\nValidate that the selected methodology is appropriate to meet the research objectives. The first step is to identify whether rapid ethnography is the right approach to answer the research questions and objectives. A common question is how long does it take to conduct a rapid ethnography? Although there is no set rule on how much time is sufficient to conduct it, most experts agree that the time spent in the field collecting data should be between two and six weeks. The speed of data collection will depend on the research objectives, funding, and the technical expertise of the team. So ask yourself: When are the findings needed? Can the timeline be met? Are the necessary technical and financial resources available?\nRemember that a key aspect of rapid ethnographies is to produce actionable and timely data for decision-makers. If the timeline is not feasible and available funding is limited, another method may be more appropriate.\nIdentify relevant ethical considerations. During planning, ensure that appropriate IRB permits and certifications are in place if required. This measure ensures that the research will not harm people and communities due to the project’s processes or findings.\nIdentify data collection techniques that will be prioritized. To prioritize, consider the information you want to collect and consult the practical guidelines for focus groups, interviews, and observations, as these are the most common collection techniques in REA. However, depending on the research needs and the research team’s experience, other collection techniques such as ethnographic mapping or short surveys can be implemented. See in detail the data collection techniques used in rapid ethnographies; see Annex 1.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Develop the Planning of Logistics Activities\n\nContact allies, leaders, and key actors. Engage with local partners to understand contextual factors, convene participants, and coordinate logistics. Local partners can facilitate data collection.\n\nConsiderations: - A field collection activity lasts, on average, 2 to 3 hours. Therefore, a maximum of two (2) activities per day is recommended. This ensures the quality of the data, does not exhaust the field team or the community, and avoids losing focus due to fatigue or saturation. - In addition, the schedule of activities should include the time allocated by the team to i) travel or transport to the collection sites, ii) collect data, iii) take notes, and iv) refine the field notes and integrate other resources generated.\n\nMake a schedule defining the field collection activities. Define all field collection activities and the total number of tasks to be completed and the time available for this purpose. Share the schedule with allies and key stakeholders to:\n\nConfirm participant availability on the selected dates.\nIdentify locations where activities will take place.\nEnsure there are no conflicting events in the community.\nVisual tools such as a Gantt chart are suggested for developing the schedule.\n\nVerify the location and conditions of the places where the collection activities will take place. Remember that it is essential to identify safe locations that facilitate interaction with the community. If possible, work with local community organizations and leaders. Before beginning fieldwork, gather general field information and visit the community with someone locally trusted to establish rapport and familiarize yourself with the area.\nEnsure the safety of the field team. Rapid ethnographies often take place in communities where there are high degrees of vulnerability and dynamics of violence and illegal activities, among others. Conduct a thorough risk assessment during the planning phase and prioritize the safety of both the field team and the community to minimize risks.\nEnsure that you have all the necessary materials to carry out the activities. This includes preparing incentives for participants (if applicable), refreshments, stationery, attendance lists, informed consents (if applicable), recording equipment, photographic equipment, batteries, etc.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Structure Your Team\nWhen structuring your team, carefully consider who will make up an effective and productive team. Take into account the experience required for each role and ensure that team members are well-suited to the tasks they will perform in the field. To that end:\n\nDefine who will be in the field and the characteristics that each team member should have. The best multidisciplinary teams comprise people with complementary skills and technical or subject matter expertise. In addition, teamwork has been identified as beneficial, as it facilitates the development of ethnographic research from different points of view, often integrating knowledge from various fields, areas, or topics. Three essential elements of a strong OER team are: i) expertise in qualitative methods, ii) expertise in content or topics, and iii) expertise in the local context.\n\nFirst, there should be at least one person on the project team with experience in qualitative research methods, who will be responsible for helping to keep the project on track by monitoring the quality of the data collected and training team members when necessary. This role will facilitate learning from participants due to their ethnographic orientation and sensitivity to the project.\nSecond, it is desirable to have people with thematic expertise and actively involve stakeholders. Thematic experts could guide the research team in understanding the findings nuances and connecting it with literature, as well as provide institutional context, depending on the study topic. In turn, stakeholders can act as advisors throughout the study, ensuring relevance and facilitating the incorporation of findings into practical changes.\nFinally, the team should include people who are closely involved on a daily basis with the problem or phenomenon under study. These are usually people from the local community or target population. These people are sometimes called “cultural experts.” They should be a trusted person who can help facilitate access and interaction with hard-to-reach populations and provide information on how things are organized within their community.\n\nBe aware of qualitative skills that the fieldwork team should have: The data quality produced during qualitative research activities is related to the research team’s skills in collecting the information. The literature has identified specific competencies (cognitive empathy, monitoring, self-recognition, heterogeneity, and palpability) that enable fieldwork teams to understand in depth the perceptions, meanings, and motivations of the people they are studying and to recognize and adequately represent diversity within qualitative data.\n\nThe skills described in Table 3 are acquired, developed, and strengthened through years of study and practice in qualitative methodologies. However, field teams tend to be multidisciplinary in monitoring and evaluating social programs and have varying levels of experience. For now, there are no metrics to measure the prevalence of these skills in those who moderate qualitative fieldwork. Therefore, the skills in the following table should be understood as a resource for reference and reflection among the teams.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Desirable Skills in the Field Team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\nDescription\nWhy is this skill important?\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect more deeply with participant’s realities and experiences. Helps to create a relationship of trust and respect with the participants. Seeks to avoid generalizations and stereotypes that may arise from preconceptions or external influences such as previous studies. Enhances understanding of participants’ situations without resorting to pity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. Contributes to obtaining deeper responses from participants. Enables exploration of emerging themes during data collection. Helps detect and validate patterns observed in the field.\n\n\nSelf-awareness and reflexivity\nThe field team’s ability to continuously reflect on how their presence, background, and assumptions influence data collection, interpretation, and analysis. This ongoing self-reflection ensures that the qualitative field team is mindful of its impact on the research process and the participants.\nHelps maintain ethics in the researcher-participant relationship. Facilitates understanding of personal limitations in connecting with participants. Aids in developing strategies to overcome communication barriers and create an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nThe field team’s ability to represent and reflect the diversity within the group being studied. This skill involves recognizing and documenting the differences and variations among individuals or subgroups during qualitative research, typically applied during the data analysis phase.\nContributes to challenging generalized and simplistic patterns. Ensures that data reflect both common and atypical experiences. Demonstrates the field team’s ability to identify, recognize, and document heterogeneity in the population studied.\n\n\nPalpability\nThe field team’s ability to provide detailed descriptions in their field notes or diaries, making the data tangible and clear. This involves avoiding abstract descriptions and, instead, offering vivid accounts that allow the research team to visualize and understand participants’ experiences and contexts.\nReliable findings are supported by specific details that clearly depict the events and situations studied. Helps to avoid abstraction in the data, grounding conclusions in concrete evidence.\n\n\n\n\nAssign roles and functions to each team member. Before starting the collection, define the roles and functions of the field team. Some key roles and functions must be assigned to achieve the proposed objectives. To do this, make a role assignment matrix to organize the tasks of contacting or scheduling participants, logistics of access to the territory, information collection, data flow closure, and analysis.\n\n\n2.1.4 Plan to Ensure Effective Fieldwork and Secure Storage of Gathered Information\nIn addition to logistical planning, the team must decide how to handle the collection and secure management of data to ensure its quality and facilitate its subsequent systematization. To this end:\n\nDefine who will lead data collection and reception within the team. From the beginning, one person should lead the instrument design, data collection, resources reception (based on fieldwork results), and analysis. Ideally, this person should have experience applying qualitative research methods and be involved in fieldwork and data collection. This person’s involvement in the project’s different stages will make it easier to manage the information collected and ensure the integration of the various sources and resources.\nDefine a note-taking strategy for the different activities. Note-taking is an essential activity across all data collection activities in REA, even if recordings are available.\n\nFor note-taking, the team leader should agree with the team on:\n\nFormat that everyone will use for their note-taking\nCritical aspects that require more or less attention from the team to address in the notes\nTypes of formats that could complement the notes (photographs, videos, maps, etc.)\nDates for intermediate and final results\n\nHaving a common understanding of these processes will ensure the smooth flow of data collection and a clear scope of each role within the team.\n\nStudy the instruments, scripts, and practical guides provided to ensure data quality during data collection. Before fieldwork, all team members should familiarize themselves with the characteristics of the instruments and the type of notes and supplementary resources to be generated in each case. Use the practical guides provided to prepare accordingly for the prioritized techniques.",

    "text": "3. What to Do During and After the Rapid Ethnography?\n\n3.1 During Rapid Ethnography\nIn addition to gathering information through the prioritized data collection techniques, it is essential to allocate time for regular team meetings during fieldwork. The success of rapid ethnographic assessments (REA) often depends on team interaction and the triangulation of data sources, methods, and perspectives. To ensure this:\n\n3.1.1 Establish Periodic Check-In Meetings with the Team\nDuring fieldwork, the team should meet periodically to share insights and determine if adjustments are needed for upcoming activities. These debriefing sessions are a key component of rapid ethnography and should be scheduled to ensure they are not overlooked.\nConsiderations: - Due to time constraints, it’s tempting to skip check-ins or leave discussions for after fieldwork is complete—this is a mistake! - Sharing information in a group setting improves the quality of data collection and subsequent analysis. Make sure blocks of time are scheduled in advance for these meetings. - Ideally, teams should have these sessions once every two days during fieldwork. These sessions help identify topics needing additional information and those that may have reached saturation where no new information is emerging.\nGuiding Questions for Check-Ins: - Were there any unexpected or stressful events? - How well did you perform as an interviewer, moderator, observer, or note-taker? - What kind of data did you collect? - Are there any gaps that need follow-up? - What adjustments would you make to the data collection guides or techniques? - Are there new sites or contexts that need observation?\nTake notes during these meetings to track follow-up actions. These sessions are also a chance to discuss the project’s progress, address logistical challenges, and provide team members with training or advice on collection techniques.\n\n\n3.1.2 Potential Challenges During Check-Up Meetings and Fieldwork Development\n\n\n\nTable 4: Challenges and Solutions During Check-Up Meetings and Fieldwork\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nPossible Solutions\n\n\n\n\nOne team member usually dominates the conversation during debriefing meetings\nEmphasize the importance of teamwork during training. Rotate facilitators for check-in meetings to give everyone a chance to lead and ensure balanced participation. Foster an environment where each team member shares their insights.\n\n\nField teams may encounter challenges in implementing reflexivity practices when conducting REAs\nEncourage ongoing communication about biases that may influence data interpretation. Adapt meeting formats to fit fieldwork dynamics. Use flexible field diaries to document biases while accommodating the pace and nature of the research.\n\n\nThere is an evident lack of consistency in collecting information among the field team\nImplement standardized data collection tools and provide clear instructions on using them. During training, discuss the context of the REA and emphasize shared best practices for approaching unstructured situations.\n\n\nSome team members need to pay more attention to the ethical aspects of the research\nAccelerated timelines can lead to ethical lapses. Emphasize the importance of ethical practices during training and ensure that all team members understand how to uphold ethical standards to protect participants and maintain data integrity.\n\n\nTeam members say they are uncomfortable with the activities they witness\nDiscuss potential uncomfortable situations during training so that team members are prepared. If discomfort arises in the field, reassign less sensitive tasks to the team member and ensure they can perform their role without bias. Some team members may be unsuitable for certain projects due to personal beliefs or values.\n\n\nSome team members are trained and oriented quantitatively and unfamiliar with REAs and qualitative methods\nProvide thorough training on qualitative methods and the specific REA protocols. Ensure that all team members understand their roles in data collection, including note-taking and techniques. Rotate tasks to allow everyone to gain hands-on experience in different aspects of the REA process.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 After REA Collection Activities\n\n3.2.1 Perform Data Management and Preparation\nUse of Photographic Material: Photographs are excellent complements to field notes. While they don’t need to be technically perfect, their primary function is to document key details and provide contextual information. However, always follow ethical guidelines to ensure participants’ safety and confidentiality before taking photographs.\nOnce data collection is complete, the team will have multiple sources of information, resources, and data from the research activities conducted in the field. To ensure proper management of these data, the following steps are suggested:\n\nFirst, after each data collection journey, each team member must ensure secure data collection storage according to the protocols for developing human subject research defined for the project.\n\nFollow these steps: - Transfer all recordings, photographs, and audiovisual material to the designated folders or storage platforms. - Name files according to protocol. - Anonymize and encrypt sensitive material to protect participants’ privacy.\nRemember: The lack of initial documentation products jeopardizes all the information processing components and, therefore, the data quality obtained.\n\nSecond, field notes are the primary data source for rapid ethnographies, so it is crucial to write and expand them as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours of collection. To do this, integrate complementary material and resources, such as photographs, videos, maps, drawings, field diaries, etc., into the field notes, according to the protocols and quality criteria agreed upon with the team in the planning phase. Standardizing this process will save time during the systematization phases, prevent data loss, and facilitate the project leader’s review of the information.",

    "text": "4. Considerations for Conducting Digital Ethnographies\nThe internet and digital technologies have accelerated the way people live, work, and relate to each other. In response to this social phenomenon, digital ethnography has emerged, a method that studies how people behave and interact in virtual environments, creating communities in digital spaces.\nDigital ethnography adapts traditional ethnographic research techniques to studying online cultures and communities formed through communications mediated by a computer or mobile device. Instead of physically being in a community, researchers immerse themselves in online communities, forums, and social networking platforms. This way, the digital ethnographer observes and analyzes how individuals interact in these virtual spaces.\nTechniques commonly used in digital ethnography are participant and non-participant observation, interviews, focus groups, and short surveys. To conduct a digital ethnography, follow the steps described above for performing a rapid ethnography. In addition, these considerations will be useful when adapting this method to a digital environment.\n\nTable 5: Considerations and Challenges in Digital Ethnographies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nPossible Solutions and Recommendations\n\n\n\n\nEthical concerns: Informed consent\nObtaining informed consent from online participants can be challenging.\nWhenever possible, contact participants and share and socialize the informed consent. Some platforms may have specific terms of service, but it is essential to ensure that participants understand the research and agree to participate voluntarily.\n\n\nEthical concerns: Anonymity and privacy\nProtecting the privacy and anonymity of participants in virtual environments is becoming more complex.\nSome platforms may have specific terms of service and data processing. Please review these terms. Researchers should inform participants if they intend to share information so that appropriate measures can be taken and the risk of participant identification minimized if the participant does not wish to be identified.\n\n\nDigital divide: Disparities in access\nNot everyone can access the Internet or digital devices equally.\nBe mindful of access gaps that may lead to a biased sample, excluding certain demographic groups and limiting the generalizability of the findings.\n\n\nDigital divide: Low digital literacy\nParticipants may have no or low skills in handling technological devices, which may affect their online behaviors.\nThese differences should be considered when presenting findings during the data analysis and interpretation phases. When using WhatsApp, use the application’s various resources, such as voice notes, images, videos, and stickers, to convey information accurately, directly, and responsively to users with these difficulties.\n\n\nData quality and authenticity: Incorrect representation\nParticipants may present themselves differently online, creating a potential gap between their online persona and offline identity.\nNote that automated accounts, trolls, and fake profiles can complicate data interpretation and introduce biased information into the analysis. Always be aware of the potential for misrepresentation in digital environments.\n\n\nLow participation: Interaction at problematic times\nParticipants may need help participating in the activities due to schedule conflicts or lack of time availability.\nConduct baseline surveys to identify the schedules that best meet the population’s needs. From the beginning, underline clear rules about desirable times to receive messages.\n\n\nLow participation: Lack of trust\nParticipants may be distrustful of being artificially linked to virtual communities.\nMake prior contact with participants before linking them to virtual spaces to introduce them to the organization. Present again the purpose of the research. Sometimes, participants do not complete the informed consent form.\n\n\nInterpretation: Difficulty in interpreting content\nMessages shared by participants may present an interpretive challenge for the researcher, as the tone of the message is attributed by the reader.\nActively moderate to ask counter-questions to clarify the message. Promote clear communication in written messages. Record questions arising from participation in virtual scenarios from participant interactions in your field diary or field note.",

    "title": "Conducting Qualitative Observations",
    "section": "What are observations?",
    "text": "What are observations?\nObservations are a qualitative research data collection technique that identifies traits, behaviors, and interactions of individuals and their contexts through the senses and interpretations of the researcher.1 Typically, the results of observations are detailed descriptions of what the field researcher observed, heard, and interpreted during the research activities. Thus, observation is a subjective data collection technique that relies on observation, note-taking, and interpretation skills.2 Depending on how the fieldwork is conducted, observations can be classified as either participant or non-participant.\n\nParticipant Observation\nIn participant observation, researchers actively participate and interact in daily activities or specific contexts of the participants.3 This allows for a first-hand understanding of participants’ daily practices, perspectives, and relationships. For example, a researcher might join community leaders on journeys to identify transport needs for accessing a social program.\n\n\nNon-Participant Observation\nIn non-participant observation, the researcher analyzes the behavior and relationships of participants without intervening (or intervening as little as possible) in the context or activity. Observers position themselves in a suitable place to listen and observe interactions without making comments or participating. For example, a researcher might conduct asynchronous remote observations through video recordings to identify how public school teachers reinforce gender stereotypes among students.\n\n\nUnstructured vs. Structured Observations\nIn both participant and non-participant observations, the level of data structuring varies based on the fieldwork approach and the expected research outcomes:\n\n1. Unstructured Observations\nUnstructured observations use open-ended questions in data collection instruments to obtain highly descriptive and narrative information from the researcher. For example, researchers mapping the challenges of caring for children might attend a guided tour with facilitators who share their experiences and suggest improvements to support children’s well-being. This approach is suitable in the following contexts:\nWhen to Use Unstructured Observations:4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Research\nWhen the research topic is relatively unknown or when exploring a phenomenon without preconceived notions or rigid frameworks.\n\n\nComplex or Dynamic Settings\nIn environments where behaviors or interactions are complex and unpredictable, allowing the observer to capture a wide range of activities and interactions.\n\n\nContextual Understanding\nWhen aiming for a deep, holistic understanding of a setting, context, or culture without predefined categories.\n\n\nFlexibility Required\nWhen the researcher needs flexibility to follow interesting leads or unexpected occurrences during observation.\n\n\nDeep Immersion\nWhen deeply understanding the culture, practices, and perspectives of a group by experiencing them firsthand.\n\n\nHidden Behaviors\nWhen certain behaviors or interactions are not visible to outsiders, requiring the researcher to become part of the group.\n\n\nBuilding Trust\nWhen establishing trust and rapport with participants is essential for obtaining accurate data, best achieved through involvement.\n\n\nSensitive Topics\nWhen studying sensitive or private behaviors that participants may not openly share with an outsider.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Structured Observations\nStructured observations use closed-ended questions to obtain specific information, resulting in short responses, counts, or responses on scales. For example, researchers might conduct asynchronous observations of recordings to identify how often teachers in public educational institutions reinforce gender stereotypes among young children. This approach is suitable in the following contexts:\nWhen to Use Structured Observations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nFocused Research\nWhen the research aims to collect specific, consistent, and comparable data across different settings or subjects.\n\n\nQuantifiable Data Needed\nWhen the researcher needs to quantify behaviors or interactions, making it easier to analyze and compare results.\n\n\nPredefined Variables\nWhen the study has clear research questions or hypotheses, and the researcher knows exactly what behaviors or events to observe and record.\n\n\nConsistency Across Observers\nWhen multiple observers are involved, ensuring consistency in data collection to maintain reliability.\n\n\nObjectivity\nWhen maintaining a level of detachment is important to avoid influencing participants’ behavior.\n\n\nEthical Concerns\nWhen participation might raise ethical issues, such as situations where the researcher’s involvement could affect the outcome.\n\n\nNatural Behavior\nWhen observing natural, unaltered behavior is critical, and the presence of a participant observer might alter how people act.\n\n\nLarge Groups\nWhen studying large groups or public behaviors where direct participation isn’t feasible or necessary.\n\n\nComparative Studies\nWhen comparing behaviors across different groups or settings, requiring a consistent, detached observational stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing Between Structured and Unstructured Approaches\nParticipant observations often align with an unstructured approach, as the richness of these activities typically relies on the events, topics, and places that emerge during fieldwork. In contrast, structured observations often align with a non-participant approach, allowing research teams to standardize observations and minimize interference with the context. The choice between structured, unstructured, or mixed approaches depends on the specific needs of the study and its research design. In practice, these approaches are not mutually exclusive, and research teams can combine both during fieldwork.",

    "section": "Planning an observation",
    "text": "Planning an observation\nPreparing for an observation involves several key steps: i) planning logistical aspects for the development of the observations, ii) structuring the team that will carry out the observation, iii) knowing the objectives of the research and becoming familiar with the observation instruments, and iv) taking into account recommendations for carrying out the observation.\nThe logistical elements and resources that you need to keep in mind when planning for an observation are the following:\nUnderstand What You Will Observe: The first step is to review the observation matrix or other relevant study materials, paying attention to the following aspects:\n\nObjectives of the observation.\nType of observation to be conducted (e.g., unstructured participant).\nActivities to be carried out.\nPeople, places, and territories involved in the observation context.\nTiming and extent of the fieldwork.\n\nContact Allies, Leaders, and Key Actors: For participant observations, it is recommended to contact local people who will accompany the observations, provide context, and facilitate the activities. For non-participant observations, allies or leaders can assist with logistics and offer valuable recommendations to the research team.\nReview Research Ethics and Safe Data Handling Protocols: Two aspects must be taken into account when approaching an observation ethically:\n\nEnsure that all necessary permissions have been obtained from communities and partners involved to conduct observations.\nObtain informed consent from participants, particularly when collecting audio, image, or video records.\n\nEnsure You Have an Observation Guide and Note-Taking Format: During the planning phase, you should make sure that:\n\nYou understand how the observation will be conducted.\nYou have adapted the note-taking strategy to the context of the observation (digital, paper).\nYou are clear on the expected outputs at the end of the field activities.\n\nVerify the Location and Conditions of the Observation Site: Since observations often take place in participants’ everyday environments, it’s essential to ensure that the site is comfortable and suitable for the observation.\n\n1. Structure your team\nThe team members who develop the observations vary considerably according to the scope of the research and the resources available to achieve these objectives.\nObservation teams should ideally consist of at least two members who conduct observations together. Having multiple observers broadens the perspectives on the observed contexts and enhances the collection of resources, such as audiovisual material.\nHowever, if budget constraints limit the number of observers, this could potentially affect the quality of the activity and the data collected. Additional participants might be necessary, especially in sensitive or high-security contexts.\nWhen structuring your team, consider how individual observer characteristics might influence data collection. The team should reflect on which aspects might introduce bias or cause resistance from the population being studied. Understanding the context and the population is crucial for this exercise.\n\n\n2. Understanding the Desirable Skills of the Field Team\nThe quality of data produced during qualitative research activities is closely related to the skills of the moderator and facilitator.5 These competencies, outlined in Table 1, enable teams to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within qualitative data.\nWhile these skills are typically developed through years of study and practice, field teams often consist of individuals from multidisciplinary backgrounds with varying levels of experience. Regardless of experience level, it is important to review and discuss these skills with your team to identify possible gaps and opportunities for improvement.\nCurrently, there are no standardized metrics to measure the prevalence of these skills among qualitative fieldwork moderators. Therefore, the skills in Table 1 should be viewed as a resource for reference and reflection for teams.\nEnsuring that everyone on the team understands how these competencies contribute to effectively engaging with the population is essential for collecting high-quality information.\n\nTable 1: Desirable skills in the field team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\nDescription\nWhy is this skill important?\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect more deeply with participant’s realities and experiences. Helps to create a relationship of trust and respect with the participants. Seeks to avoid generalizations and stereotypes that may arise from preconceptions or external influences such as previous studies. Enhances understanding of participants’ situations without resorting to pity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. Contributes to obtaining deeper responses from participants. Enables exploration of emerging themes during data collection. Helps detect and validate patterns observed in the field.\n\n\nSelf-awareness and reflexivity\nThe field team’s ability to continuously reflect on how their presence, background, and assumptions influence data collection, interpretation, and analysis. This ongoing self-reflection ensures that the qualitative field team is mindful of its impact on the research process and the participants.\nHelps maintain ethics in the researcher-participant relationship. Facilitates understanding of personal limitations in connecting with participants. Aids in developing strategies to overcome communication barriers and create an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nThe field team’s ability to represent and reflect the diversity within the group being studied. This skill involves recognizing and documenting the differences and variations among individuals or subgroups during qualitative research, typically applied during the data analysis phase.\nContributes to challenging generalized and simplistic patterns. Ensures that data reflect both common and atypical experiences. Demonstrates the field team’s ability to identify, recognize, and document heterogeneity in the population studied.\n\n\nPalpability\nThe field team’s ability to provide detailed descriptions in their field notes or diaries, making the data tangible and clear. This involves avoiding abstract descriptions and, instead, offering vivid accounts that allow the research team to visualize and understand participants’ experiences and contexts.\nReliable findings are supported by specific details that clearly depict the events and situations studied. Helps to avoid abstraction in the data, grounding conclusions in concrete evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Study the observation guide\nThe resources designed for observation help guide the observer, with varying degrees of structure depending on the research design. Observation guides are characterized by:\n\nAlignment with Research Objectives: The guide should directly relate to the goals of the research.\nIdentification of Key Characteristics: It should clearly identify the characteristics that need to be observed.\nAppropriate Scope: The guide should contain a manageable number of statements for the characteristics being observed, ensuring it is comprehensive but not overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember:\n\n\n\nFor note-taking, you can use narrative resources, photographs, drawings, or examples to describe participants’ interactions and reactions, as appropriate.\n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the characteristics of the instruments and the type of information expected to be generated (e.g., field notes, diaries, or activity logs). If the observation is conducted in a group, it is advisable to study the instruments together and agree on the general criteria you wish to observe.\n\n\n4. Be prepared to make observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nParticipant Observation\nNon-Participant Observation\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Involvement\nActively participates and interacts with participants.\nObserves without intervening or with minimal intervention.\n\n\nData Collection\nRich, detailed, and subjective data based on personal experiences and interactions.\nObjective data focused on specific behaviors and interactions.\n\n\nAdvantages\nProvides deep insights and understanding of participants’ perspectives and daily practices.\nMinimizes researcher influence on participants’ behavior, allowing for natural observation.\n\n\nChallenges\nRisk of researcher bias and influence on participants’ behavior.\nLimited ability to understand participants’ internal thoughts and feelings.\n\n\nSuitable Contexts\nWhen deep immersion and understanding of participants’ culture and practices are required.\nWhen observing natural, unaltered behavior is critical, and the presence of a participant observer might alter actions.\n\n\nExamples\nResearcher joins community leaders to understand transport needs.\nResearcher observes teachers’ behavior through video recordings without interacting.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Practices for Both Observation Types\n\nMaintain a curious attitude towards the events being observed.\nTrain your memory to accurately record information in your observation forms.\nIntegrate good practices with the necessary skills for effective observation.",

    "text": "Conducting an observation\n\n1. How to start an observation?\n\nIntroduction: Begin by introducing yourself and clearly explaining each team member’s role and the session’s general dynamics.\nInformed Consent: If appropriate, read the informed consent, ensuring that all participants clearly understand the purpose of the activity and the potential risks and benefits of their involvement. Given the variety of formats collected (e.g., audio, video, images), informed consent must cover the full scope of the activity. Beyond the formal process of informed consent, make sure that the people, group, or community being observed know about the study and its aims.\nCreating a Comfortable Environment: Whether it’s participant or non-participant observation, it’s crucial to create a comfortable and calm atmosphere to avoid discomfort and encourage spontaneity.\nAttitude: Show interest, friendliness, and respect for all contributions, and maintain a curious and open-minded attitude, even when discussions are lengthy or opinions differ from your own.\nNote-taking: Take notes on your observations or make audiovisual records according to your study’s requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations\n\n\n\nIn prolonged observations it is desirable to supplement the notes of the research activities with field diaries.\n\n\n\n\n2. Possible challenges\n\nTable 2: Possible challenges for observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\nDistrust on the part of the participants\nWhile the presence of observers inherently alters the participants’ daily routine, it can also lead to increased distrust among some individuals.\nProvide a detailed introduction, clearly explaining the purpose of your visit and the activities involved. Reassure participants that they are not being evaluated or judged. Use electronic devices like a computer or cell phone to record key ideas, which may make participants feel less directly observed. If the observation was planned as non-participant, consider engaging in the activities to create a more comfortable environment.\n\n\nDifficulty in documenting all data\nBalancing observation with participation can make it challenging to document all relevant information that arises during the activity.\nPrioritize information that is most relevant to your research. Focus on the research objectives and follow the observation guide to maintain attention on key aspects. Take quick notes during the observation, using keywords or key concepts to capture essential details.\n\n\nObjectivity vs. subjectivity\nSince observation is a subjective technique, it is crucial to differentiate between your interpretations and the descriptive elements of the environment.\nWrite your diary or field note in three stages: Describe the environment and the participants’ interactions. Detail your own participation in the space. Record reflections and interpretations that emerge from the observation. Remember that it is essential to keep a distance from the observation activities. You should participate in the spaces while maintaining an objective view from a distance.6\n\n\nGenerating agreement on assigned values\nUsing quantitative scales in observations can be challenging, as it requires consensus on what each observer should record in each response box.\nEstablish clear observation agreements or use standardized rating rubrics to ensure consistency across observers. Start with an unstructured observation to identify any biases or concerns, then proceed to a structured observation based on those insights. When assigning values on a scale, provide a rationale in additional comments to clarify why a particular category was selected.",

Upon returning:\nReview Notes: Revisit your notes and elaborate on key observations.\nWrite Observation Notes: Include descriptions of the environment, participant interactions, your participation, and any reflections or interpretations that arise.\nSupplement Your Notes: Add photographs, drawings, or maps as necessary.\nDocument Preliminary Findings: In cases of extensive fieldwork, summarize preliminary findings in field diaries based on the various collection techniques used.\n\n1. Possible errors to avoid during data closure\nThe quality of note-taking is critical to the success of the collection technique; errors to avoid are:\nNeglecting Note-Taking: Avoid delaying note-taking; it should be done during or immediately after the research activity.\nInadequate Refinement: Ensure that notes are refined and completed within 24 hours of the observation to capture accurate details and reflections.\nEthical Practices: Always adhere to ethical practices in data closure, particularly in protecting research subjects.",

    "text": "Online observations\nDigitally mediated observations can be conducted in two primary ways:\n\nVideo Conferencing: An observer connects remotely via a video conferencing platform, supported by an in-situ facilitator.\nAsynchronous Review: Observers analyze recordings of activities at a later time.\n\nBoth methods involve non-participant observation with a significant physical distance from the context being studied. This distance can lead to a disconnect between the observer and the participants’ reality, potentially limiting the depth of reflections and interpretations. Despite these limitations, virtual observations can provide valuable insights, particularly in evaluating specific aspects of social programs. For instance, quantitative data can be collected by observing recorded class sessions, contributing to assessments of program impact.\nVirtual observations can also serve as an alternative when constraints arise in the following resources:\n\nTime: When scheduling conflicts or time zone differences make in-person observations impractical.\nBudget: When financial limitations restrict travel and accommodation expenses.\nAccessibility: When physical access to the observation site is challenging due to geographical or logistical barriers.\nHealth and Safety: When health risks, such as during a pandemic, prevent in-person interactions.\nEthical Concerns: When the presence of an observer might influence participants’ behavior or when anonymity is crucial.\n\nBy leveraging digital tools and platforms, researchers can continue to gather valuable data while adapting to various constraints and ensuring the safety and well-being of both observers and participants.\n\nTable 3: Resource constraints for making observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstraint\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEconomic\nDifficulty affording transportation for collection equipment.\n\n\nTemporary\nUrgency in generating responses may preclude the time-intensive planning required for fieldwork.\n\n\nStaff\nLimited availability of personnel to ensure the proper functioning of equipment in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Challenges and Solutions in Remote Observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\nVolume of observations\nConducting around 500 observations posed significant logistical challenges, requiring large teams and extensive resources.\nUse audiovisual recordings to capture information, which the designated team can then review.\n\n\nObserver profile\nIf the project’s focus on socio-emotional skills necessitates observers with specific professional expertise.\nIdentify the appropriate observer profile, both professionally and personally. For example, psychologists with experience in emotional intelligence and observation were selected.\n\n\nObserver out of context\nRemote observations can detach observers from the context, particularly when others collect the data, leading to a lack of crucial contextual understanding.\nDevelop critical questions for the collection team, focusing on specific aspects like site characteristics, time of observation, participant attitudes, and unrecorded comments to help the observer understand the context. Promote dialogue between the collection team and the observers to bridge contextual gaps.\n\n\nMultiple observers\nAsynchronous observation on a large scale often involves multiple observers with varying personal and professional backgrounds, potentially influencing the observation outcomes.\nCreate a structured observation guide that includes item descriptions and relevant examples to ensure consistency. For instance, provide examples of teacher actions related to emotional recognition, regulation, and validation. Conduct group observation exercises to align and verify observation standards.\n\n\n\nLast updated December 2024.",
