## Repository structure

### Branching strategy
* The `main` branch is the live and most up-to-date version of the Hub, publicly available to all IPA staff and external users. 
* Use `realease` branches for new content that will be published/released in the short term. It can also include potential topics and ideas worth discussing (both from GRDS and non-GRDS contributors).
* Use `update` branches to update/modify content that is already published in the Hub. 
* Use `feature` branches for modifications to the hub's infrastructure and scaffolding (e.g., the site's theme, layout, navigation, hierarchy, content blocks, prototypes, etc.).
* Use `hotfix` branches for critical/time sensitive issues affecting the live version of the Hub. These must be prioritized, fixed, and merged into the `main` branch ASAP.
* Use `bugfix` branches for less urgent fixes that must be resolved, but are not as time-sensitive to be considered hotfixes.
