Thank you for your interest in contributing to the IPA Research and Data Science Hub! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to follow professional standards of communication and respect the time and efforts of others. Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative in your approach.

## How can you contribute?

There are several ways you can contribute to the Research and Data Science Hub:

1. **Add new content**: Create new guides, tutorials, or documentation
2. **Update existing content**: Improve or expand existing documentation
3. **Fix typos or errors**: Help us maintain high-quality content
4. **Suggest improvements**: Open issues for content or features you'd like to see
5. **Enhance functionality**: Contribute to the technical infrastructure of the Hub

You can contribute through any of the following methods:

* Edit pages directly in the GitHub Repository [https://github.com/PovertyAction/ipa-research-data-science-hub](https://github.com/PovertyAction/ipa-research-data-science-hub), requires a GitHub account
* Open an issue on GitHub to suggest changes or report problems, [Report an issue](https://github.com/PovertyAction/ipa-research-data-science-hub/issues/new)
* Contact the IPA Research and Data Science Hub team at [researchsupport@poverty-action.org](mailto:researchsupport@poverty-action.org) if you have content you would like to contribute but are not comfortable using GitHub. GRDS can help you convert your content into the appropriate format and add it to the Hub.
* If you are an IPA staff member, you can also contact the GRDS team on the `IPA - Colab - Research` group on Microsoft Teams by using `@researchsupport` in a message.

## Git Development Workflow

If you want to contribute code or content, we use Git for version control and collaboration. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of our workflow:

### Branching Strategy

- Use `release/*` branches for new content
- Use `update/*` branches to modify existing content
- Use `feature/*` branches for technical infrastructure modifications
- Use `hotfix/*` branches for critical issues
- Use `bugfix/*` branches for non-urgent fixes

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PovertyAction/ipa-research-data-science-hub.git
   cd ipa-research-data-science-hub
   ```

Install dependencies using this helpful `Just` command:

```bash
just get-started
```

This will install all required software and create a Python virtual environment.
Note that you may need to install `Just` if you don't have it already.

```bash
# For Windows users
winget install Casey.Just

# For macOS/Linux users
brew install just
```

Some of the documents require that you have Python, R, or Stata availabl on your computer.
Use the `_environment.required` file as a template to create your own `_environment.local` file.
This file should contain any local environment variables you need, such as:

```bash
# Path to the Python interpreter for Quarto
QUARTO_PYTHON=.venv\Scripts\python.exe  # For Windows users
QUARTO_PYTHON=.venv/bin/python # For macOS/Linux users

# Path to the R interpreter for Quarto
QUARTO_R="C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.1" # For Windows users
QUARTO_R=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/R # For macOS/Linux users
```

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch-type/descriptive-name
   ```

   Replace `branch-type` with one of: `release`, `update`, `feature`, `hotfix`, or `bugfix`.

2. Make your changes to a document

3. **Test your changes**

   Preview the site locally:

   ```bash
   just preview-docs
   ```

4. **Format and lint your changes**

   ```bash
   just fmt-all
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

6. **Push your changes**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin branch-type/descriptive-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**

   Go to the repository on GitHub and open a pull request.

## Writing Content in Quarto

The IPA Research and Data Science Hub uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for content creation and site generation. Quarto is an open source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.

### File Structure

- Content is organized by topic area in directories
- Each directory should have an `index.qmd` file
- Use consistent naming conventions for files: lowercase, hyphenated names (e.g., `data-collection.qmd`)

### Quarto Basics

- Content is written in Markdown with Quarto extensions
- Quarto files use the `.qmd` extension
- Each file should begin with YAML frontmatter defining metadata

Example YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My New Page"
description: "Description of the page content"
date: last-modified


#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Authors
#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Authors are the main creators of the site's content, credited
# for their work and responsible for its core development,
# including writing and editing.
#------------------------------------------------------------------
authors-ipa:
   - "Author 1"
   - "Author 2"
   - "Author 3"

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Contributors
#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Contributors provide support, such as feedback or supplementary
# materials for the site. They can also be responsible for
# updating/maintaining the site.
#------------------------------------------------------------------
contributors:
   - "Contributor 1"
   - "Contributor 2"
   - "Contributor 3"
---
```

### Special Features

Quarto supports many advanced features:

#### Callout Blocks

Use callout blocks to highlight important information:

```markdown
::: {.callout-note}
This is a note callout.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Pro Tip"}
This is a tip with a custom title.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
This is a warning callout.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
This is an important callout.
:::

::: {.callout-caution}
This is a caution callout.
:::
```

#### Cross-References

Create cross-references to other sections, figures, or tables:

```markdown
See @sec-methodology for more details.

## Methodology {#sec-methodology}
```

#### Code Blocks with Execution

Include executable code (Python, R, etc.) with output:

````markdown
```{python}
import numpy as np
data = np.random.randn(100)
print(f"Mean: {data.mean():.2f}")
```
````

#### Tabsets

Group content into tabs:

```markdown
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Tab 1
Content for the first tab

## Tab 2
Content for the second tab
:::
```

See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) for more features.

## Markdown Style Guide

We use markdownlint with custom rules to ensure consistent formatting. See our [Markdown Style Guide](docs/MARKDOWN_STYLE.md) for detailed guidelines.

Key points:

- Use [ATX-style headings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html#atx-style-headings) with a space after the `#` (e.g., `## Heading 2`)
- Use asterisks (`*`) for unordered lists, not dashes
- Include blank lines before and after headings, lists, and code blocks
- Provide alt text for all images for accessibility
- Use fenced code blocks with language specification

## Code Quality Tools

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. These run automatically when you commit changes.

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Markdownlint

We use markdownlint-cli to ensure consistent markdown formatting:

```bash
# Lint and fix all markdown files
just fmt-markdown

# Lint and fix a specific file
just fmt-md path/to/file.qmd

# Check without fixing
just fmt-check-markdown
```

The markdownlint configuration is defined in `.markdownlint.yaml`, which is used by both VS Code and the command-line tool.

### Vale

We use Vale to check writing style and grammar:

```bash
# Run Vale on all content
vale .

# Run Vale on a specific file
vale path/to/file.qmd
```

There are also several shortcuts for running Vale on specific directories or files:

```bash
# Report errors for an individual file:
just vale-errors path/to/file.qmd

# Report warnings for an individual file:
just vale-warnings path/to/file.qmd

# Report suggestions for an individual file:
just vale-suggestions path/to/file.qmd

# Report errors, warnings, and suggestion for an individual file:
just vale-file path/to/file.qmd

# Report all errors in Quarto Markdown files within the repository:
just vale-errors-all

# Report all warnings in Quarto Markdown files within the repository:
just vale-warnings-all
```
