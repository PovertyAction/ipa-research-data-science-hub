It is used by lots of researchers in different fields of study. Although there are other statistical software (including R, SAS, SPSS and Python), Stata is the primary statistical tool used at IPA due to its flexibility and ease of use and also because it is most widely used by our Principal Investigators (PIs). Over the years, IPA and J-PAL have developed a lot of training materials and user-written programs for Stata—this course is based on the work of many colleagues across many countries and projects. See [here](https://povertyaction.force.com/support/s/article/stata) for more information about Stata at IPA.\n\n## Why do we use Stata?\n\nWhile off-the-shelf software (like Microsoft Excel) is widely available and easy to use, these often lack the flexibility and sophistication required for complex statistical analyses. Stata, on the other hand, is a powerful statistical software package that provides a wide range of tools and capabilities for data analysis and management. Some of Stata's capabilities as a statistical software include:\n\n* Ability to handle large and complex datasets\n* Powerful data management and cleaning tools\n* Extensive library of statistical procedures\n* An active user community with a wide range of resources\n* High-quality graphics and visualization tools\n* Compatibility and integration with a wide range of file formats, including Excel, CSV, and SAS\n* Extensive documentation and user guides\n* Regular updates and improvements to keep up with new methods.\n\n## Installing Stata\nIf Stata is not already installed on your IPA computer, this will be your first task. Follow [these instructions](https://ipastorage.box.com/s/gai9xdcv6zkjr3p0oa6jwjv5vm521ox0) to download and install Stata. As you complete the installation, read each step carefully to ensure you are selecting the correct settings. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nRemember that Stata can be installed on any computer owned by IPA. IPA staff can manage this installation directly—you do not need to request support from MIST unless you encounter a problem. Please note that IPA's Stata license should only be used on IPA devices and should NOT be installed on your personal computers. Also note that Stata is not currently available for mobile devices. If you encounter problems after carefully reviewing all instructions, please send an email to the MIST team at [support@poverty-action.org](mailto:support@poverty-action.org).\n::: \n\n\n## The Stata Interface\nStata's interface is designed to provide users with a user-friendly environment that allows them to interact with the software and perform statistical analyses efficiently. That being said, there are several windows and tools (explained below) that you can use to interact with the software and conduct your work.\n\n![Stata's User Interface](/assets/images/stata-interface.png){fig-cap=\"Stata's User Interface\" width=85%}\n\n:::{.numbered-list}\n1. **Command window:** Displays the output of commands executed in the command window. This includes tables, graphs, and other results generated by Stata. In other words, all the results from your analyses appear here.\n2. **Results window:** Displays the output of commands executed in the command window. This includes tables, graphs, and other results generated by Stata. In other words, all the results from your analyses appear here.\n3. **History window:** This is your command history, and it shows all commands you have typed during your Stata session and all commands Stata created for you when you work with the GUI.\n4. **Variables window:** The variables window displays information about the variables in the dataset currently loaded in Stata. Users can view the variable name, label, type, and properties, among other information.\n5. **Properties window:** You can use this window to manage your variables, including their names, labels, value labels, notes, formats, and storage types.\n:::\n\nBesides the five main windows, Stata offers other specialized tools and features to help with your data-related work. Some of these include the project manager, the data and graph editors, and the do-file. More on these later.\n\n## Interacting with Stata\nYou can use the menus and toolbars contained in Stata's user interface (rather than writing code) to perform common tasks, such as opening datasets, running statistical analyses, and creating graphs. We refer to this method as **point-and-click**. To execute a specific task, you can simply click on the \"Run\" button in the toolbar.\n\n![Example of point-and-click interaction](/assets/images/stata-point-click.png){fig-cap=\"Example of point-and-click interaction\" width=75%}\n\nHowever, a more typical (and recommended) approach involves typing \"commands\" into the program to manipulate and analyze large quantities of data —we refer to this as the **command-line**. This may feel unfamiliar if you don't have a background in statistical analysis or coding, but most data-oriented professionals use the command-line approach as it eliminates the need to navigate menus and toolbars. It also allows for easier automation and scripting of analyses, which can be helpful for more advanced users.\n\n![Example of Stata commands](/assets/images/stata-command-line.gif){fig-cap=\"Example of Stata Commands\" width=75%}\n\n## Stata's command syntax\nStata syntax is the language we use to communicate with Stata. This means that, as with any other language, we need to learn it, understand it, and use it for effective communication with the software. The standard syntax of Stata commands is as follows:\n\n```stata\n[by varlist]: command [varlist] [=exp] [if exp] [in range] [weight] [using filename][, options]\n```\nWhere *varlist* denotes a list of variable names, *command* denotes a Stata command, *exp* denotes an algebraic expression, *range* denotes an observation range, *weight* denotes a weighting expression, and *options* denotes a list of command-specific options. In other words, this means that any Stata command we run is accompanied by multiple options (in brackets) that alter the output we receive from said command. Other than the command itself, everything in brackets is optional.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"Stata is case sensitive!\"}\nAnother important thing about syntax: Stata commands and syntax never come in CAPITAL LETTERS. Therefore, we always use small letters when typing Stata commands.\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n:::{.page-subtitle}\nThis page provides a brief introduction to Stata, the statistical software used at IPA for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
