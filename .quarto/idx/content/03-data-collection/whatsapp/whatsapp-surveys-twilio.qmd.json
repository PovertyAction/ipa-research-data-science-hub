Due to existing mistrust with WhatsApp, participants may approach data collection interactions skeptically. Researchers must ensure that participants have a clear option to opt out, and it is essential to obtain explicit upfront consent for these interactions. \n* Simplicity of Surveys: Since this is a remote data collection method, questionnaires must be simple. If presented with a complicated survey, participants may have doubts or concerns that no enumerator can help resolve. Therefore, it is advisable to use simple instruments for data collection to minimize attrition and ensure effective participation.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n:::{.page-subtitle}\nThis article introduces WhatsApp surveys as an alternative data collection method available for IPA projects.
