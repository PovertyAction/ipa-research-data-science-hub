This platform allows communication through calls, text, email, video, and WhatsApp. Due to its flexibility, it has been used in IPA Colombia as a tool to send WhatsApp messages and implement WhatsApp surveys. Given the number of available tools, it is flexible to adapt to the different needs of a project. \n\n* Twilio offers the following services:\n* WhatsApp surveys\n* WhatsApp chatbots\n* SMS surveys\n* Interactive Voice Response surveys (IVR)\n* Massive email campaigns\n* Customer support/assistance, virtual call center by WhatsApp, voice and video calls\n\n**What is Twilio's role to implement WhatsApp surveys?** Twilio offers an API (Application Programming Interface) integration that allows developers to use Twilio to send and receive messages on the WhatsApp platform. Businesses and developers can leverage Twilio to integrate WhatsApp messaging capabilities into their applications or systems, enabling communication with users via WhatsApp. Twilio is an intermediary that facilitates communication between the application and WhatsApp, making it easier for developers to incorporate WhatsApp messaging into their solutions. For the IPA case, Twilio facilitates the development of WhatsApp Surveys and data collection.\n\nSome main concepts that will help us get familiarized with Twilio include:\n* Twilio Console: is the centralized interface where users manage and control various Twilio services. It is the primary dashboard for configuring, monitoring and optimizing communication functionalities.\n* WhatsApp Functionality: refers to the enhanced communication capabilities unlocked by upgrading a Twilio account. This includes leveraging WhatsApp for surveys and other interactive communication.\n* WhatsApp Sender Management: Within the Twilio Console, users manage WhatsApp senders through the \"Messaging\" section. This functionality provides oversight and control over sender-related activities.\n* API Access Request: Users can create new senders within the Twilio Console, request access to the WhatsApp API, and submit necessary information for approval. This process enables integration with WhatsApp services.\n\n## Setting up a Twilio Console\n\nFollow these steps to set up a Twilio console for WhatsApp data collection:\n\n1. Go to the Twilio website [](www.twilio.com) and sign up for a new account. Provide the required information and complete the registration process.\n2. After signing up, log in to your Twilio account. Verify your email and log in.\n\n![Animation of a tesseract, a cube changing over time.](https://media1.tenor.com/images/2ed919ce9aa9018d8d19f474cbb90847/tenor.gif){#fig-tesseract width=75% style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\"}\n\n![Twilio setup and login](/assets/images/twilio-1.gif){fig-cap=\"Twilio setup and login\" width=75% style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\"}\n\n3.

Upgrade the account to be able to use the WhatsApp functionalities.\n\n## Twilio Pricing and Fees\nNavigating through Twilio's pricing structure is essential for businesses seeking reliable and scalable communication solutions. As a leading cloud communications platform, Twilio offers diverse services, each with its own pricing considerations. The standard pricing is described as follows:\n\n* The cost to start a conversation (for 24 hours) is USD 0.010\n* The cost for a user to initiate the conversation (for 24 hours) is USD 0.006\n* Fixed price per WhatsApp number USD 1.00\n* Cost per message of USD 0.005\n\nUnderstanding these pricing options is essential to include in the project budget. It is important to acknowledge that some capabilities, such as WhatsApp, require buying a phone number, and the configurations are set to have automatic top-ups. We recommend the standard configuration on this page so that Twilio can run smoothly. \n\n## Verifying your Twilio Console\n\nFollow these steps to get your Twilio console verified. After submitting the required formats for approval, please note that it may take approximately **one week** for everything to be set up. Once your sender is approved, you can proceed to create the WhatsApp profile in the next section.\n\n1. In the Console, click on the \"Messaging\" dropdown in the top-left corner and select the \"Senders\" tab on the left-hand side to view the available WhatsApp senders.\n2. To send WhatsApp messages, you need to create a new sender and request access to the WhatsApp API. Click on the \"Create New Sender\" button and fill out the following fields. Select the phone number bought in previous steps and complete the profile information.\n3. Once you're familiar with the requirements and guidelines, click on the \"Submit request\" button to start the request process.\n\n![The Twilio console](/assets/images/twilio-console-3.png){fig-cap=\"The Twilio console\" width=75%}\n\nThere is an optional step to complete the Meta verification, which grants the account the green tick in WhatsApp. This is highly recommended if you intend to send WhatsApp messages to a skeptical population and aim to enhance response rates in your surveys. To proceed, click on the \"Open Meta Business Verification\" button and follow the provided steps.\n\n## Creating a WhatsApp Profile\n\nLastly, navigate to the newly created sender and provide the necessary information that will be displayed in the profile. This includes adding an image, name, and a description according to your preferences.Once you complete this step, you are ready to start with your first WhatsApp survey.\n\n![The Twilio console](/assets/images/twilio-console-3.png){fig-cap=\"The Twilio console\" width=75%}\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n:::{.page-subtitle}\nThis resource provides a quick introduction to WhatsApp surveys, Twilio, and how to perform initial tasks such as setting up a Twilio console, procuring a phone number, and completing a verification process. \n:::\n\n## What is Twilio?\n\nTwilio is an interactive platform with customers.
