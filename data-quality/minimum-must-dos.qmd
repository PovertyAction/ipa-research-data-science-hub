## Develop a Data Quality Assurance (QA) Plan before launch of each data collection round
:::{.custom-summary-block}
Before each new round of data collection, a detailed Data Quality Assurance (QA) Plan must be created. This plan outlines all data quality measures — like backchecks, high-frequency checks, accompaniments, and spot checks—that are specifically designed for applicable survey modes (phone, WhatsApp, in-person, and qualitative interviews).

:::{.callout-note collapse=true title="click here for more details"}
A strong Data Quality Assurance (QA) Plan is key to maintaining high data standards during data collection. The QA plan must be created before each round of data collection to ensure quality control measures stay current and can adapt to changes or lessons learned from previous rounds.

**Required Deliverables:**

[Approved QA Plan]{style="color: orange;"}  
**Due:** At most 3 days to the launch of data collection. Recommended to develop data collection plan before enumerator training. This ensures that enumerators are properly trained on their role in ensuring data quality. The QA Plan must be finalized, reviewed and approved by the by the Research Manager & PIs.  
**Purpose:** This plan should outline all activities, including when and how data quality issues will be checked and the required actions that will be used to resolving or mitigating data errors. 
:::


## Bench test survey instruments
:::{.custom-summary-block}
Before field data collection begins, the survey must be thoroughly bench-tested in the office with at least three testers. This process should ideally be completed at most two weeks to launch of actual data collection. It ensures the survey works well across all modes (phone, WhatsApp, in-person, and qualitative) and that even small changes are properly validated.

:::{.callout-note collapse=true title="click here for more details"}
To reduce survey programming errors and save time and money, it is crucial to thoroughly bench your data collection method before it is deployed for actual data collection - survey methods which do not require enumerator can also be benchtested by using enumerators or research staff as initial test respondents eg. SMS surveys can be pushed to the Field Manager. Bench testing means running your survey in the office with at least three different testers. During bench testing, testers use the survey in various scenarios and give feedback and the programmer makes any necessary changes. Bench testing is an iterative process and should be done whenever changes are made to the survey instrument. Remember, even small changes require re-testing, as minor errors can affect other parts of the survey. It is best to use a mix of experienced and new enumerators during this process.

**Required Deliverables:** 

[Bench Test Report]{style="color: orange;"}  
**Due:** After every round of bench testing  
**Purpose:** The report documents, when and how the bench testing is done as well as important information such as the number of testers involved, the number of submissions made during testing and a list of issues flagged during the testing process. 
:::


## Pilot survey instruments
:::{.custom-summary-block}
Before the full survey launch, a pilot of the survey instruments must be conducted. This pilot should closely simulate actual surveying conditions including testing every survey question, however, testing should not be done with the actual data collection sample. For surveys using Digital Data Collection, both the survey program and devices must be tested to identify and correct any issues prior to full implementation.

:::{.callout-note collapse=true title="click here for more details"}
Every survey must be rigorously piloted to ensure that the instruments function as intended and that all questions are easy to comprehend. This pilot phase is crucial for validating the survey design, survey workflow and overall functionality under conditions as close to real-world field data collection as possible. Piloting of survey instruments should be conducted in communities that are outside the final study sample to prevent any influence on the actual survey data. However, the project team must ensure that the pilot environment replicates the intended survey conditions as closely as possible.

Schedule sufficient time after the pilot to analyze feedback and address any identified errors or issues.
Piloting of the survey instruments is an iterative process and the project team must ensure that even minor changes go through the necessary review before full-scale deployment.

**Required Deliverables:**

[Pilot Report]{style="color: orange;"}  
**Due:** At most one week before launch of data collection  
**Purpose:** The pilot report contains information about when and how the piloting was conducted as well as any issues flagged. The pilot report should be shared with the research management team and the PI.

::: {.callout-note collapse=true title="click here for more details"}
To ensure high data quality and proper implementation of survey protocols across across survey teams, each surveyor must be accompanied at least once during the first week of the survey. This accompaniment serves several key purposes:

**Performance Monitoring:** Supervisors directly observe field officers’ techniques, ensuring that survey questions are asked as intended and that the overall data collection process aligns with established protocols.

**Early Detection of issues:** In-person monitoring helps quickly identify any survey issues, such as misinterpretation of questions or errors in surver, allowing for prompt corrective action before such issues impact a larger portion of the data.

**Required Deliverables:**

[Field Monitoring Report:]{style="color: orange;"}  
**Due:** Before the first 10 days of data collection  
**Purpose:** The field monitoring report will contain Observations, Feedback, Issues and follow up actions for each surveyor based on observations in the first week of data collection. These can be the basis to implement additional data quality measures or additional training as needed.

:::  {.callout-note collapse=true title="click here for more details"}
High frequency checks provide insight into ongoing field team and data quality concerns before they become too entrenched or too late to manage. By running HFCs, you can regularly analyze (comparative) enumerator performance, programming issues, compliance with ethics requirements, response frequencies and outliers, duplicates, and other project-specific data quality issues. HFCs are meant to provide the evidence needed to successfully guide and manage a field team on a daily basis, and thus must be accompanied by strict guidance on roles and responsibilities, reporting schedules and triggered actions (e.g. what outliers would trigger re-interviewing a household).

**Required Deliverables:**

[1. Programmed HFC check files]{style="color: orange;"}  
**Due:** At most 1 day before starting each round of data collection  
**Purpose:** Ensure that all automated HFC tools are fully programmed and tested. This step makes sure that the monitoring systems are ready to capture real-time data quality metrics right from the beginning of the data collection round.

[2. HFC Correction Report/Log (Weekly Update)]{style="color: orange;"}  
**Due:** Weekly during active data collection  
**Purpose:** Document any data quality issues found, the actions taken to fix them, and any changes needed to the HFC protocols. This report is a key tool for ongoing quality control and offers practical insights to help manage field operations continuously.

::: {.callout-note collapse=true title="click here for more details"}
Data validation protocols are essential for making sure the data collected in multi-mode surveys is both accurate and reliable. These protocols provide clear methods to check the quality of data gathered through various channels—whether it’s in-person, by phone, through WhatsApp, or in qualitative interviews. Research teams must choose and use at least one of the following data validation methods:

**Backcheck Survey:** 
A qualified field officer re-interviews a sample of respondents using some of the same questions. The new responses are then compared with the original answers to spot any differences that might indicate problems with the questionnaire or the field officer’s performance.

**Respondent Validation:** 
Respondents receive a summary of their answers and are asked to confirm that the recorded responses are correct, ensuring that the data reflects their true views. This will usually cover questions that are unlikely to change and can be used to confirm that survey was administered to the correct respondent and survey protocols where followed. Respondent Validation can be used in cases where back checks are not feasible especially due to sensitivity or subjectivity of the research questions

**Audio Audits:** 
Interviews are recorded and then reviewed manually for signs of data fraud or breach of research protocols. This helps confirm that the interviews were conducted correctly and that the data was entered accurately.

**Response Entry Reliability (Including Double Entry for Paper Surveys):** 
For electronic surveys, a sample of responses is re-entered to check for consistency. This could be done through an audio recording or by direct observation from a supervisor. For paper surveys, two different clerks independently enter the data, and the two sets are compared to catch any transcription errors.

**Inter-Rater Reliability Test:** 
In situations where multiple field officers or raters score or code responses, this test measures how much they agree with one another. High agreement indicates that the data is recorded consistently.

**Measurement Reliability Test:**
When using specialized equipment like stadiometers, tape measures or weight scales, it is important to ensure that the measurements are consistent. This test involves having a different group of enumerators re-measure a small sample of the population. The results are then compared to check for consistency. This approach is especially useful for tasks like anthropometric assessments and measuring farm produce.

For any chosen validation method, a clear implementation plan must be developed. This plan should include a strategy for randomly selecting samples, detailed steps for conducting the validation and an action plan to fix any discrepancies found. 

**Required Deliverables:**

[1. Approved QA Plan]{style="color: orange;"}  
**Due:** At most 3 days before the launch of data collection. Recommended to develop data collection plan before enumerator training. This ensures that enumerators are properly trained on their role in ensuring data quality during data collection. 
The QA Plan must be finalized, reviewed and approved by the by the Research Manager & PIs.  
**Purpose:** This plan should outline all activities, including when and how data quality issues will be checked and the required actions that will be used to resolving or mitigating data errors. 

[2. Data Validation Report (Weekly Update)]{style="color: orange;"}  
**Due:** Weekly during active data collection  
**Purpose:** This report summarizes this week’s data validation efforts, including the protocols applied, the issues identified and the corrective actions taken. The goal is to maintain data accuracy and consistency across all survey modes.

Closing out an IRB is a necessary final step in the research process, ensuring that all study-related ethical obligations are fulfilled. A project should be retired when:

All study interventions and activities are complete.
- The research team is no longer actively working with identified data.
- For the IPA IRB, official project retirement occurs when both conditions are met. However, other IRBs may have additional requirements, such as final reports or confirmations that data de-identification is complete. Researchers should coordinate with their reviewing IRB administrators to comply with all necessary protocols.

Failure to properly retire an IRB can lead to unnecessary administrative burdens, confusion in compliance reporting, or complications in future research approvals. Maintaining thorough documentation of IRB closure ensures that all ethical requirements have been met, providing a clear record for institutional accountability.
