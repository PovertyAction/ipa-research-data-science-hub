Accompanying surveyors is a key step in ensuring high-quality data collection. It allows us to monitor data quality, provide feedback, and detect any issues early in the survey process. By demonstrating our commitment to accuracy, we also set expectations for the team and reinforce the importance of ethical and accurate data collection.

## Motivations for Accompanying Surveyors

- **Ensuring Accuracy:** Observing surveyors helps verify that questions are asked correctly and consistently.
- **Understanding Respondent Reactions:** We can identify whether respondents interpret questions as intended.
- **Detecting Issues Early:** Mistakes or inconsistencies can be caught and corrected before they affect the dataset.
- **Improving Surveyor Performance:** Providing targeted feedback helps surveyors improve their skills.
- **Building Accountability:** Regular monitoring discourages falsification and reinforces ethical data collection.
- **Strengthening Relationships:** Engaging with surveyors shows we value their work and experience their challenges firsthand.

## How to Accompany Surveyors

1. **Full Accompaniment at the Start:**
   - During the initial days of the survey, each surveyor should be observed for an entire interview to ensure they understand and apply the questionnaire correctly.

2. **Ongoing Partial Accompaniment:**
   - As the survey progresses, accompanying can be limited to key sections of the interview (e.g., 2-3 sections per visit).

3. **Structured Observation and Feedback:**
   - Use standardized forms to document observations and track surveyor performance.
   - Provide immediate feedback and follow up on recurring mistakes.

4. **Random and Scheduled Visits:**
   - Mix planned and unannounced visits to get a realistic picture of surveyor performance.

5. **Escalation for Persistent Issues:**
   - Address repeated mistakes with training or corrective actions.
   - If necessary, implement penalties or contract termination for continued poor performance.

## Monitoring and Reporting

- **Research Protocol:** At least 10% of surveys must be accompanied to comply with best practices.
- **Survey Diary:** Maintain a log of observations and feedback for continuous improvement.
- **External Resources:** See the paper version and SurveyCTO XLS form of IPAâ€™s accompaniment [template](/assets/files/IPA_Accompaniment_Form_Template.xlsx) for documentation and reporting.
