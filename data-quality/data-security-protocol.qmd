> This page will help you familiarize yourself with data security protocols to ensure the protection of both hardcopy and softcopy data throughout your project.

## What is the Data Security Protocol?

The data security protocol is a set of guidelines and practices designed to protect data from unauthorized access, corruption, or loss.

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
### Definition
PII refers to any data point or combination of data points that can identify an individual or household with reasonable certainty.

### Examples of PII

- Name
- GPS coordinates
- Address
- Combinations of demographic data (e.g., village name, birth date, gender, occupation in small communities)

### Protection Requirements
PII must be protected using the following protocols:

- **Encryption:** Apply encryption at every stage of the data lifecycle (collection, transmission, storage).
- **Separation:** Separate PII from research data as soon as possible.
- **Ongoing Protection:** Protect PII retained after study closure.
- **Exclusion:** Exclude PII from microdata publications (e.g., AEA registry).

### Sharing PII
PII may only be shared under the following conditions:

1. The recipient is named or referenced in the informed consent (e.g., researchers, partners).
2. The recipient is included in the approved research protocol.
3. Secure methods are used for sharing.

## Importance of Data Security

- **Compliance:** Required by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and donors.
- **Prevention of Data Loss:** Avoid costly data breaches or losses.
- **Respect for Respondents:** Protect respondents' privacy and confidentiality.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure data quality for sharing and publication.

---

## Sensitive Data
### Definition
Sensitive data is information where a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could result in serious, severe, or catastrophic consequences.

### Sensitivity Levels

- **Level 1:** Not confidential.
- **Level 2:** Contains PII, but no material harm.
- **Level 3:** Contains PII and could cause material harm.
- **Level 4:** High-risk confidential data.

---

## Examples of PII (Based on 45 CFR 164.514 - HIPAA Standard)

- Names
- Geographic subdivisions smaller than a state/province
- Dates directly related to an individual (except year)
- Telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses
- Social security numbers, medical record numbers, health plan beneficiary numbers
- Account numbers, certificate or license numbers, vehicle identifiers, device identifiers
- Web URLs, IP addresses, biometric identifiers (e.g., fingerprints, voice prints)
- Full-face photos or any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code

---

## Access to PII

- Only individuals **approved in the IRB submission** can access PII.
- Approved individuals must complete **human subjects protection training** (e.g., CITI Program certification).

---

## Password Security
### Creating a Strong Password

- At least **10 characters**.
- Use a **mix** of numbers, symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters.
- Avoid repetition, dictionary words, usernames, pronouns, IDs, and predefined sequences.

### Password Best Practices

- **Never share passwords via email.**
- **Use a secure password manager.**
- **Use a complex password consistently across the project.**

**Example:**
*The New Hampshire training was awesome because of the data security presentation* → **TnhtwabotDSP_13**

---

## Data Protection Summary
Ensure your data is always:

- **Produced** through a clear step in your data flow.
- **Saved** to a logical and secure location.
- **Password-protected** with a strong password.
- **Encrypted** if it contains PII or sensitive data.
- **Backed up** regularly in multiple locations.

---

## Data Flow FAQ

### When to Keep Data Secure
Secure data whenever sensitive information is linked to PII. Raw data containing PII must be **encrypted and stored securely**.

### When and How to Remove PII

- **Remove PII as soon as possible.**
- Collaborate with your team to determine who will remove PII and when.
- **Stata Tip:** Use the `lookfor` command to identify PII.


## Device Security

### General Device Security

- Consult the Data Coordinator for recommended devices.
- Encrypt all sensitive data.
- Password-protect devices.
- Physically secure and label devices.

### Field Device Management

- Implement **check-in/out systems** for devices.
- Train staff **not to broadcast locations or activities.**
- Ensure **signed device liability forms.**
- Maintain **charging schedules and fire safety precautions.**
- Assign responsibility for **nightly device checks.**
- Label devices **with QR code stickers.**
- Store **netbooks in protective casings.**

### Laptop & Personal Device Security

- **Use IPA’s encryption software** for PII.
- **Avoid unapproved programs.**
- **Run antivirus scans regularly.**
- **Backup data securely (e.g., Box).**
- **Work computers only:** No personal files.

### Laptop/Netbook Security in the Field

#### User Accounts

- **Create two accounts:**
- **Admin account:** Full rights.
- **Enumerator account:** Limited access.

#### Functionality Restrictions

- **Set accurate date and time.**
- **Disable internet access** if unnecessary.
- **Disable audio, video, and USB ports** unless required for data extraction.

#### Software & Protection

- Install **antivirus software** (e.g., Avira, Avast!).
- **Encrypt sensitive survey data** (e.g., Cryptomator).
- **Regularly update and back up data.**

---

## Data Backup & Storage

- Use **central/supervisor computer backups.**
- **Local backups:** External hard drives with automated backup software (e.g., CrashPlan).
- **Cloud backups:** IPA’s encrypted cloud storage (Box) with additional encryption (Cryptomator).

## Conclusion
By adhering to these data security protocols, we ensure compliance, safeguard respondent privacy, and maintain the integrity of research data.
