## Key Takeaways

* Protecting sensitive data and PII is essential to maintain respondent confidentiality and comply with ethical standards.
* Implementing robust encryption, password security, and backup practices ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized access.
:::

## What is the Data Security Protocol?

The data security protocol is a set of guidelines and practices designed to protect data from unauthorized access, corruption, or loss.

### Importance of Data Security

* **Compliance:** Required by Institutional Review Boards and donors.
* **Prevention of Data Loss:** Avoid costly data breaches or losses.
* **Respect for Respondents:** Protect respondents' privacy and confidentiality.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensure data quality for sharing and publication.

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

PII refers to any datapoint or combination of datapoints that can identify an individual or household with reasonable certainty. Examples of PII can include:

* Name
* GPS coordinates
* Address
* Combinations of demographic data, village name, birth date, gender, occupation in small communities

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}

## Data Protection Requirements

PII must be protected using the following protocols:

* **Encryption:** Apply encryption at every stage of the data lifecycle: collection, transmission, storage.
* **Separation:** Separate PII from research data as soon as possible.
* **Ongoing Protection:** Protect PII retained after study closure.
* **Exclusion:** Exclude PII from microdata publications like the AEA registry.
:::

In terms of sharing PII, this kind of information may only be shared under the following conditions:

1. The recipient is named or referenced in the informed consent.
2. The recipient is included in the approved research protocol.
3. Secure methods are used for sharing.

### Sensitive Data

Sensitive data is information where a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could result in serious, severe, or catastrophic consequences.

### Sensitivity Levels

* **Level 1:** Non-confidential.
* **Level 2:** Contains PII, but no material harm.
* **Level 3:** Contains PII and could cause material harm.
* **Level 4:** High-risk confidential data.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## Examples of PII (Based on 45 CFR 164.514 - HIPAA Standard)

Based on 45 CFR 164.514 HIPAA Standard, some examples of PII may include:

* Names
* Geographic subdivisions smaller than a state/province
* Dates directly related to an individual (e.g., birth date, graduation date, marriage date)
* Telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses
* Social security numbers, medical record numbers, health plan beneficiary numbers
* Account numbers, certificate or license numbers, vehicle identifiers, device identifiers
* Web URLs, IP addresses, biometric identifiers like fingerprints
* Full-face photos or any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code
:::

## Access to PII

* Only individuals **approved in the IRB submission** can access PII.
* Approved individuals must complete **human subjects protection training** like CITI Program certification.

## Password Security

### Creating a Strong Password

* At least **10 characters**.
* Use a **mix** of numbers, symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters.
* Avoid repetition, dictionary words, usernames, pronouns, IDs, and predefined sequences.

### Password Best Practices

* **Never share passwords through email.**
* **Use a secure password manager.**
* **Use a complex password consistently across the project.**

**Example:**
*The New Hampshire training was awesome because of the data security presentation in 2024* â†’ **TnhtwabotDSPi2024!**

This creates a 17-character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols while being memorable through the sentence structure.

## Data Protection Summary

Ensure your data is always:

* **Produced** through a clear step in your data flow.
* **Saved** to a logical and secure location.
* **Password-protected** with a strong password.
* **Encrypted** if it contains PII or sensitive data.
* **Backed up** in multiple locations.

## Data Flow FAQ

### When to Keep Data Secure

Secure data whenever sensitive information is linked to PII. Raw data containing PII must be **encrypted and stored securely**.

### When and How to Remove PII

* **Remove PII as soon as possible.**
* Collaborate with your team to determine who will remove PII and when.
* **Stata Tip:** Use the `lookfor` command to identify PII.

## Device Security

### General Device Security

* Consult the Data Coordinator for recommended devices.
* Encrypt all sensitive data.
* Password-protect devices.
* Physically secure and label devices.

### Field Device Management

* Implement **check-in/out systems** for devices.
* Train staff **not to broadcast locations or activities.**
* Ensure **signed device liability forms.**
* Maintain **charging schedules and fire safety precautions.**
* Assign responsibility for **nightly device checks.**
* Label devices **with QR code stickers.**
* Store **netbooks in protective casings.**

### Laptop and Personal Device Security

* **Use IPA's encryption software** for PII.
* **Avoid unapproved programs.**
* **Run antivirus scans frequently.**
* **Backup data securely using tools like Box.**
* **Work computers only:** No personal files.

### Laptop/Netbook Security in the Field

#### User Accounts

* **Create two accounts:**
* **Admin account:** Full rights.
* **Enumerator account:** Limited access.

#### Functionality Restrictions

* **Set accurate date and time.**
* **Disable internet access** if unnecessary.
* **Disable audio, video, and USB ports** unless required for data extraction.

#### Software and Protection

* Install **antivirus software**.
* **Encrypt sensitive survey data** using tools like Cryptomator.
* **Update and back up data regularly.**

## Data Backup and Storage

* Use **central/supervisor computer backups.**
* **Local backups:** External hard drives with automated backup software like CrashPlan.
* **Cloud backups:** IPA's encrypted cloud storage through Box with additional encryption using Cryptomator.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these data security protocols, organizations ensure compliance, safeguard respondent privacy, and maintain the integrity of research data.
