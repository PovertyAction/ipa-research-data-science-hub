> This article describes what data count as PII, what materials should be anonymized, and methods for anonymization of datasets.

## What is Data Anonymization?

Data anonymization is the act of removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from study materials. Before starting any analyses, consider carefully whether you will need PII. Most analyses will not require PII. Typically, the only use for PII is to link data from different sources, as well as analyses reliant on geographic data, which will be addressed below.

If PII is not necessary for the analysis, then it should be split from the data immediately. In most cases, there is no reason to share PII with PIs. Instead, anonymize the data immediately using the `split_pii` Stata program and share only the anonymized data with PIs, which can be downloaded through SSC.

PII includes information that can be used to specifically identify an individual. Due to the nature of the research we conduct, we are entrusted with the management of PII of the participants of our research studies. This information should not be released to external individuals, including in most cases PIs and users who access publicly accessible materials, such as from IPA's Data Repository. Therefore, it is vital that staff have access to strategies to remove this data to ensure the safety of research subjects.

## 1. What data count as Personally Identifiable Information?

IPA conforms to the HIPAA guidelines for what data count as PII. Included in the list are:
- Names
- Geographic areas with a population of 20,000 or fewer
- Birth date
- Contact information such as phone numbers
- License numbers
- Indirect identifiers that, in combination with several sets of information, can uniquely identify an individual

Because IPA conducts studies in countries outside of the US, the list of PII should be adapted to the relevant country context.

## 2. What materials should be anonymized?

Aside from the names of PIs and, in some cases, current project staff, ensure that PII is removed from:
- Data
- Code
- Survey instruments
- Any other documentation that will be shared with non-IRB-approved staff and external users

Data and code should be prioritized because most PII will be found in those two sets of files. However, review all other documents that will be shared as well.

Automated searches for PII in Stata datasets are discussed below, but for code, surveys, and other documentation, manual review is typically required.

For users with advanced programming skills, Python can skim documents for relevant information. However, a manual check is still recommended in case certain keywords are missed.

IPA is currently testing a PII treatment application. Learn more about it here: **IPA's Personally Identifiable Information Treatment Application.**

## 3. How to Search Datasets for Personally Identifiable Information

To ensure a Stata dataset does not contain PII, carefully review the variables it contains. It may not be immediately clear that a variable contains PII. Conduct at least two sweeps of one or more datasets for clear instances of PII. Sweeps can be done either using Stata code or manually.

### Using Stata

A quick way to screen for PII in Stata is the `lookfor` command. It searches all variable names and labels in a dataset for one or more keywords.

```stata
lookfor name
```

This command lists all variables whose name or variable label contains the string "name." For example, a variable named `fname` (for "first name") would be listed because "name" is a substring of `fname`. `lookfor` also stores the list of variables in the saved result `r(varlist)`.

To quickly search more than one dataset, use the `lookfor_all` command, available on SSC. To install, type:

```stata
ssc install lookfor_all
```

### Keywords to Search For

Below is a list of keywords to consider searching for (not exhaustive):

- `name`
- `birth` (to find variables related to the respondent's birthdate)
- `phone`
- `district`
- `county`
- `subcounty`
- `parish`
- `lc` (to find variables related to the respondent's "local council," a geographical unit in some countries)
- `village`
- `community`
- `address` or `gps`
- `lat` (to find variables related to latitude)
- `lon` (to find variables related to longitude)
- `coord` (to find variables related to GPS coordinates)
- `location`
- `house`
- `compound`
- `school`
- `social`
- `network`
- `census`
- `gender` (in limited cases)
- `sex` (in limited cases)
- `fax` or `email`
- `ip` (for IP addresses)
- `url` (for Web addresses)
- `specify` or `comment`

### Searching Through String Variables

Search through string variables and their values to screen for PII. Field officers may collect non-uniform answers in string variables, which can contain PII such as names, small locations, and contact information.

To display the full length of string values:

```stata
levels of varname
```

If PII is contained in strings with standardized values, recode them using:

```stata
replace varname = subinstr(varname, "PII VALUE", "ANONYMIZED VALUE", .)
```

If PII is contained in strings but the values are irregular, manually recode them:

```stata
replace varname = "STRING VALUE WITHOUT PII" if varname == "STRING VALUE WITH PII"
```

In both cases, maintain the integrity of the string value if it contains useful information. Otherwise, create a blank or "other" value based on the variable's structure.
