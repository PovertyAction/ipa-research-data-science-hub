## Key Takeaways

- **Double Entry:** A method to ensure data accuracy by independently entering data twice and comparing for discrepancies.
- **Maintaining Data Backups:** Protects against data loss by storing multiple copies in different locations with version control.
- **Storing Files on Box:** Ensures secure access, collaboration, and compliance with data protection policies.

## What is Data Integrity?

Ensuring data integrity and security is crucial for high-quality research. This involves verifying data accuracy through **Double Entry**, protecting against loss by **Maintaining Data Backups**, and ensuring secure access by **Storing Files on Box**. Adopting these best practices minimizes errors, preserves data, and promotes reliability.

## Double Entry

**Definition:** Double entry is a method where researchers enter data twice independently and then compare the entries to detect discrepancies.

**Steps:**

1. **Initial Data Entry:** Enumerators or data clerks enter data from source documents into the database.
2. **Second Independent Entry:** A different person re-enters the same data into a separate database.
3. **Comparison and Validation:** Researchers compare the two datasets to identify inconsistencies.
4. **Error Resolution:** Staff review discrepancies and correct them using the original source.

**Why it Matters:**

- Reduces human error in manual data entry.
- Ensures higher accuracy and reliability of data.
- Essential for sensitive data where precision is critical.

**Best Practices:**

- Use automated comparison tools to speed up validation.
- Train staff on accurate data entry techniques.
- Implement a tracking system to monitor common errors.

## Maintaining Data Backups

**Definition:** A backup is a copy of data stored to protect against accidental loss, corruption, or hardware failure.

**Steps:**

1. **Automated Backups:** Schedule automatic backups at regular intervals.
2. **Multiple Storage Locations:** Store backups in at least two locations, such as cloud storage or an external drive.
3. **Version Control:** Maintain different versions of files to recover previous states.
4. **Regular Testing:** Periodically restore files to ensure backups are functional.

**Why it Matters:**

- Prevents loss of critical research data.
- Ensures continuity in case of system failure.
- Protects against accidental deletions and cyber threats.

**Best Practices:**

- Use encrypted backups to secure sensitive data.
- Follow the 3-2-1 rule: Keep three copies of data, on two different media, with one copy offsite.
- Document backup procedures for easy recovery.

## Storing Files on Box

**Definition:** Box is a secure cloud storage platform that allows teams to store, access, and share files efficiently.

**Steps:**

1. **Upload Files to Box:** Organize files into appropriate folders.
2. **Set Access Permissions:** Restrict access based on roles, such as view-only, edit, or admin.
3. **Enable File Versioning:** Maintain previous versions to track changes.
4. **Use Encryption and Two-Factor Authentication:** Enhance data security with two-factor authentication (2FA).

**Why it Matters:**

- Provides secure storage with controlled access.
- Facilitates team collaboration with real-time file sharing.
- Ensures compliance with data protection policies.

**Best Practices:**

- Audit file permissions and access logs.
- Use Box Sync or Box Drive for seamless integration with local storage.
- Set up automated alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
