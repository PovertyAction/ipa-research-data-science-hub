> In this page, you will find the procedures for ensuring data integrity in research. We will cover methods such as **Double Entry** for verifying data accuracy, **Maintaining Data Backups** to protect against data loss, and **Storing Files on Box** for secure access. These best practices help minimize errors, preserve data, and promote reliability.


## What is the Data Integrity?

Ensuring data integrity and security is crucial for high-quality research. This involves verifying data accuracy through **Double Entry**, protecting against loss by **Maintaining Data Backups**, and ensuring secure access by **Storing Files on Box**. Adopting these best practices minimizes errors, preserves data, and promotes reliability.

### Double Entry
**Definition:** Double entry is a method where data is entered twice independently and then compared to detect discrepancies.

**Steps:**

1. **Initial Data Entry:** Enumerators or data clerks enter data from source documents into the database.
2. **Second Independent Entry:** A different person re-enters the same data into a separate database.
3. **Comparison & Validation:** The two datasets are compared to identify inconsistencies.
4. **Error Resolution:** Discrepancies are reviewed and corrected using the original source.

**Why it Matters:**

- Reduces human error in manual data entry.
- Ensures higher accuracy and reliability of data.
- Essential for sensitive data where precision is critical.

**Best Practices:**

- Use automated comparison tools to speed up validation.
- Train staff on accurate data entry techniques.
- Implement a tracking system to monitor common errors.

### Maintaining Data Backups
**Definition:** A backup is a copy of data stored separately to protect against accidental loss, corruption, or hardware failure.

**Steps:**

1. **Automated Backups:** Schedule automatic backups at regular intervals.
2. **Multiple Storage Locations:** Store backups in at least two locations (e.g., cloud and external drive).
3. **Version Control:** Maintain different versions of files to recover previous states.
4. **Regular Testing:** Periodically restore files to ensure backups are functional.

**Why it Matters:**

- Prevents loss of critical research data.
- Ensures continuity in case of system failure.
- Protects against accidental deletions and cyber threats.

**Best Practices:**

- Use encrypted backups to secure sensitive data.
- Follow the 3-2-1 rule: Keep 3 copies of data, on 2 different media, with 1 copy offsite.
- Document backup procedures for easy recovery.

### Storing Files on Box
**Definition:** Box is a secure cloud storage platform that allows teams to store, access, and share files efficiently.

**Steps:**

1. **Upload Files to Box:** Organize files into appropriate folders.
2. **Set Access Permissions:** Restrict access based on roles (e.g., view-only, edit, admin).
3. **Enable File Versioning:** Maintain previous versions to track changes.
4. **Use Encryption & Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhance data security.

**Why it Matters:**

- Provides secure storage with controlled access.
- Facilitates team collaboration with real-time file sharing.
- Ensures compliance with data protection policies.

**Best Practices:**

- Regularly audit file permissions and access logs.
- Use Box Sync or Box Drive for seamless integration with local storage.
- Set up automated alerts for unauthorized access attempts.

### Conclusion
Combining **Double Entry**, **Maintaining Data Backups**, and **Storing Files on Box** creates a robust framework for data integrity and security. Implementing these strategies ensures accuracy, prevents data loss, and upholds research standards effectively.
