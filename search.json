Note that collapse works by replacing your data with the summary statistics of each variable that you request. If you are familiar with egen, you can think of collapse as equivalent to egen, except than rather making a new variable it replaces your variables. Additionally, any variables you don’t specify will be dropped. This means this command erases your data. Because of this destructive nature there are several best practices to use around collapse.\nIt is common you would like to maintain your dataset while outputting some summary statistics. You can quickly do this by preserving, collapsing, and then restoring your data.\nsysuse census, clear\npreserve\ncollapse (mean) pop (median) medage, by(region)\nsave \"example.dta\", replace\nrestore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why you use the statistic you choose\n\n\n\nIn the comments of your do-file, you should write why you chose the collapse statistic you chose for each variable. This is especially important when multiple statistics would result in the same thing and you chose one arbitrarily. For example, if you have a constant variable for what you are collapsing on, so you pick mean instead of mode or first non missing, this is important for someone to know later. If they are adding in more data and run into errors they need to know why you picked what you did and it will help them understand the data structure and errors.",

Components of the handbook are written in Markdown, either standard Markdown (.md) or Quarto Markdown (.qmd). The benefit of standard markdown is that it is more portable and works with standard Markdown editors (e.g. GitHub), while Quarto markdown allows for computations that are embedded in the document. If you want more advanced formatting or computations, .qmd may be a preferable choice. The Quarto Documentation provides helpful guides on how to use Markdown as well as the added features that Quarto Markdown offers.\nFor an example of how to use Quarto within common academic and research workflows, see:",

This means that if you are collecting data from someone, but this data is not in any way “about” them, they may not count as a human subject.\nFor example: if your project involves interviewing factory workers, and you will only ask them questions about operations at the factory – what time it opens, steps in the manufacturing process, etc. – these interviewees may not count as human subjects. This applies as long as you do not collect PII or any other information “about” them.\nThis sometimes comes up in the context of projects which involve interviews with staff or other key players in a program which IPA is evaluating. These interviews may not count as human subjects research if the questions focus only on learning about the program and how it functions—not anything specific to that interviewee or their experience.\nHowever, if your survey includes questions asking the interviewee for their opinion about something—e.g., what do you think about this part of the program?—this may count as human subjects research.\n\n\nIs your project research?\nFederal regulations define “research” as:\nA systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.\nThe end of this definition – “designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge” – is the part most often relevant for determining whether IPA projects are considered research.\n“Generalizable knowledge” typically means that the project will generate information that expands the knowledge base of a scientific discipline or other scholarly field of study and yield one or both of the following:\n\nResults that are applicable to a larger population beyond the site of data collection or the specific subjects studied.\nResults that you will use to develop, test, or support theories, principles, and statements of relationships, or to tell policy makers beyond the study.*\n\nSome projects that IPA works on fall outside of this category because their purpose is “program evaluation only.” This means that the project’s purpose is only to evaluate a specific program, and the only stakeholders interested in results of the study are program administrators or other entities interested specifically in the development or efficacy of that program. The results of the project will not support conclusions about these types of programs in general.\nProjects which fit the above description may not qualify as “research” and thus may not require IRB review.\n*Explanation borrowed from University of Washington Human Subjects Division",

    "text": "Do pilot activities need IRB review?\nSometimes…Read on!\nThe purpose of a pilot is typically to evaluate the feasibility of a study and help researchers refine data collection procedures, instruments, or research design. They are usually small in scale and exploratory in nature.\nPilot activities are typically aimed at preparing for future, core research activities—those which will generate results that answer the main research questions.\nPilot activities are thus not research if you intend them only for this purpose and they will not contribute to generalizable knowledge. This means that you will not use results of the pilot as research data.\nPilot studies therefore typically do not require IRB review, with one key exception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nException\n\n\n\nIf the pilot itself may create notable risks for subjects, IPA IRB may wish to review these activities. If your pilot will involve particularly vulnerable subjects, particularly sensitive questions/data collection, or research methods which may create greater than minimal risks, consult with IPA IRB at humansubjects@poverty-action.org before beginning fieldwork.\n\n\nIf you will use data collected through a pilot study for generalization or publication purposes—solely or in combination with other data—IRB review requirements apply before data collection begins. You may not later repurpose pilot data collected without IRB approval as study data, and the IRB cannot provide retroactive review.*\n*Explanation borrowed from Georgia Southern University Research Integrity",

    "section": "Your project is human subjects research—now what?",
    "text": "Your project is human subjects research—now what?\nIf your project is human subjects research – that is, it involves human subjects, and it is research rather than a pilot – you must submit an initial application for IRB review.\nHowever, it is still possible that your project may qualify for exemption from some future IRB oversight requirements.\n\nCategories of exempt research\nFederal regulations outline several categories of research which qualify as “exempt.” These decision charts provide more information.\nWhether your research project fits within one or more of these categories can be difficult to interpret, so the IRB must make this determination—you cannot decide that your project is exempt.\nProjects eligible for exemption are those which are low risk. Eliminating unnecessary risks is the best way to increase the likelihood that the IRB will find your project exempt. For example: if you are conducting a study involving only one round of data collection, and it is not necessary to collect PII, opting not to collect any PII will make your study more fit for exemption.\nIf your study involves deception, prisoner subjects, or child subjects, there are additional limits on whether the IRB can determine your study exempt.\n\n\nWhat does exemption mean?\nLet’s say you’ve submitted an initial application for your project, and the IRB has determined it ‘exempt.’ What does this mean for your IRB obligations going forward?\nA determination of exemption means that the study does not need ongoing IRB oversight. This applies as long as the research remains minimal risk and stays within the bounds of the exemption categories that the IRB determined apply to this study.\nIn plain language, this means that:\n\nYou do not need to submit renewals, as long as the project stays exempt.\nYou do not need to submit amendments, as long as the changes you are making do not change or undermine the study’s eligibility for exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nProjects may begin as exempt but change substantively over time such that they no longer qualify for exemption. It is crucial that you submit to the IRB any changes which may impact the exemption status of the study.\n\n\nThese may include:\n\nAdding procedures which do not fit within the original exemption categories\nFor example: if your original plan only involved working with secondary data or educational testing, and you are now planning to survey other participants.\nChanges or new procedures that could affect risks to participants\nRemoval of the consent process, or use of deception or incomplete disclosure.\nSignificant changes to the recruitment procedures.\nCollection of new or additional identifiable information.\nAdding sensitive questions to a survey or interview process**, such as questions regarding illegal activities; traumatic events such as childhood, sexual, or domestic abuse; suicide; or other probing questions that could reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or damage the subjects’ financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation.\nChanges to the data storage plan which may affect confidentiality.\nAdding new types of participants, especially vulnerable populations: children, individuals with cognitive impairments, prisoners\n\nIf you have any uncertainty about whether a particular change necessitates an amendment submission for your exempt project, contact the IPA IRB at humansubjects@poverty-action.org.\nOther types of IRB submissions are still required:\n\nYou must still submit unexpected events if the research receives any participant complaints or experiences any unanticipated problems that involve risks to participants or others.\nYou must close the study once human subjects activities have concluded.",

    "text": "Initial Application\nThe IRB project lifecycle starts with the online submission of the initial application. Research teams submit an initial application to formally apply for IRB review and must secure approval before implementing a new research study. During this process, the IRB determines the review level – expedited or full board – and frequency of continuing review—one or three years.\nThe submission should include the following documents:\n\nIPA IRB Initial Application Form—once approved, this becomes the study’s protocol\nInstruments (e.g., surveys, interview/focus group discussion guides, observation forms)\nInformed consent forms, the IPA IRB consent checklist and template helps ensure all required and assessed elements are included\nHuman Subjects Certificates for all Principal Investigators (PIs) and research personnel. Human Subjects training certification must be renewed every three years to remain valid for approval\nIRB approval from local IRBs and/or other institutions\nData Sharing Agreements\nAny other supporting documents\n\nIPA IRB evaluates submissions on a rolling basis in the order they receive them. Upon receipt of an IRB submission for review, the IRB evaluates the research study to determine whether it involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects.\nMinimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or routine procedures.\nYou can expect to receive feedback on your submission’s risk assessment within 10 business days of your initial submission. If the submission is incomplete or requires further clarification/modification, the approval timeline will depend on the nature of the necessary changes and the responsiveness of the responsible research staff.\nIf the IRB determines your project is minimal risk, it will undergo an expedited review. In expedited review, an IPA IRB representative designated by the IPA IRB Chair conducts the review rather than the full board. The IRB conducts these reviews on an ongoing basis.\nThis means the research team does not need to wait for the next full board meeting for review or approval. Practically speaking, this means that the review usually takes less time than a non-minimal risk study.\nResearch teams cannot request expedited review, as this reflects the study’s risk level, which only the designated representative of IPA IRB can determine.\nIf a project is non-minimal risk, the IRB Coordinator or the chair will refer the study to the full IRB Board. The Board will review the study at the monthly meeting and then either propose changes or grant a decision.\nIf you think your project may be non-minimal risk, you must submit the complete materials for the study by the deadline associated with the corresponding targeted meeting date. If your submission is missing documents at the deadline, the IRB may not consider it for that meeting date.\nNon-minimal risk applications that may need full board review should allow for 60 days to process. The convened board may have questions or comments for the research staff that need re-discussion at the next meeting before approval.\nPlease note that if your pilot activity is collecting identifiable data that will be used during the study, you must budget enough time for the IRB to approve your application before starting your pilot activities.",

An IRB reviews, monitors, and, if necessary, requires modifications to these type of studies. Made up of IRB staff and board members, its primary role is to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to protect participants’ rights, safety and welfare.\nIRBs operate based on ethical principles outlined in the Belmont Report—beneficence, respect for persons, and justice—and adhere to minimum standards set by U.S. federal regulations, including the Department of Health and Human Services Regulations (45 CFR part 46). For human subject research conducted internationally, additional local regulations and international standards apply.\n\nHuman Subjects Research\nAccording to 45 CFR part 46, human subjects research means:\n\nResearch: Systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.\nHuman subject: Living individual about whom an investigator (whether a professional or student) conducting research (i) obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or (ii) obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help determining if your project involves Human Subjects Research?\n\n\n\nIRB approval is mandatory for human subjects research.

    "section": "About the IPA IRB",
    "text": "About the IPA IRB\nIn 2007, IPA established an IRB that would provide ethical oversight to international studies that were primarily randomized trials with vulnerable populations in low and middle income countries where IPA operates. This IRB is hosted by IPA and its administrative functions are handled by IPA staff, but it is independent of IPA staff, management, and researchers. The membership of the IPA IRB is diverse in affiliations and is composed of members who are external to IPA. The IRB convenes on a monthly basis.\nIRB approval is a fundamental part of IPA’s research quality protocols. IPA requires that all projects in which IPA is engaged be reviewed by a U.S. or a similar IRB institution, as well as nationally recognized (or equal) IRB in the country where the research is taking place (if such an IRB exists) before the start of any human subjects activities. When deciding how to arrange IRB coverage for an IPA project, the options are the following:\n\n\nIPA IRB: IPA IRB conducts its own review of the project.\nHealth Media Lab (HML) IRB: HML IRB may review the project in place of IPA IRB. Only projects which are minimal risk, involve no particularly sensitive questions or vulnerable subjects, and are not federally funded should submit to HML IRB.\nReliance agreement with other institution: In some cases, IRB review may be required at another institution (e.g., the PI’s university, or the institution funding the study). If you prefer that IPA IRB cedes oversight to this other institution’s IRB, we will need to set up a “reliance agreement” formally documenting this arrangement.\n\n\n\nMeeting Dates\nThe IRB at IPA convenes regularly to review non-minimal risk studies and other submissions requiring full board review. To ensure timely consideration, researchers must submit all required materials by the deadlines listed in Table 1 below. Submissions received after the deadline will be reviewed at the next available meeting. IRB meetings take place from 15:00 to 16:00 EST on the scheduled dates. Please plan accordingly to avoid delays in your study’s approval process.\n\n\n\nTable 1: IPA IRB Meeting Dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Date\nDeadline for Submission of Materials\n\n\n\n\nThursday, March 27, 2025\nFriday, March 7, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, April 24, 2025\nFriday, April 4, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, May 29, 2025\nFriday, May 9, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, June 26, 2025\nFriday, June 6, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, July 31, 2025\nFriday, July 11, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, August 28, 2025\nFriday, August 8, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, September 25, 2025\nFriday, September 5, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, October 30, 2025\nFriday, October 10, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, November 20, 2025\nFriday, October 31, 2025, COB\n\n\nThursday, December 18, 2025\nFriday, November 28, 2025, COB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIRB Fee Schedule\nThe IPA IRB charges fees for its reviews based on the IPA IRB fee schedule. For more information on these fees, see the fee update documentation. The IRB determines these fees based on several factors. These include staff time and training costs, such as processing submissions, executing reliance agreements, advising projects and responding to questions, preparing templates and customized guidance on consent forms, and recruiting and working with Board members. They also include Board member honoraria, annual CITI organizational subscription for human subjects training, and comparison research to identify fees charged by other IRBs completed in 2024.\nResearch teams should include IRB fees in every research project’s budget. Consider discussing IRB requirements during the project development stage with your donors, PIs, and implementing partners to ensure adequate budgeting for the appropriate IRB costs.",

    "text": "What is Statistical Power?\nStatistical power is the probability that a study will detect a true effect when one actually exists. Think of it as your study’s ability to avoid missing something important - like having a metal detector sensitive enough to find buried treasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor a practical introductory guide to power calculations, see Guide to Power Calculations.\n\n\n\nWhy Statistical Power Matters?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Research Quality and Reliability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures studies can detect meaningful effects\nReduces risk of false conclusions\nStrengthens confidence in research findings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Resource Optimization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevents wastage of research resources\nAvoids underpowered studies that may be inconclusive\nGuides efficient allocation of study participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Policy Impact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnables evidence-based policy decisions\nReduces risk of dismissing effective interventions\nHelps identify truly impactful programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Ethical Considerations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespects participants’ time and effort\nJustifies the use of research resources\nPromotes responsible funding and implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Improving Academic Achievement in India1\n\nIn India, a significant proportion of children age 7 to 12 were struggling with basic academic skills; 44% could not read a simple paragraph and 50% could not solve a basic subtraction problem—highlighting an urgent need for targeted support.\nThe Balsakhi tutoring program addressed this gap by providing two hours of daily remedial instruction in small groups of 15 to 20 students. To rigorously evaluate its impact, researchers conducted a large-scale randomized controlled trial involving 23,000 students. They assigned students to either a treatment group – receiving Balsakhi tutoring – or a control group – continuing with the regular curriculum.\n\n📊 The Results\n\nTest scores improved by 0.28 standard deviations for students who received tutoring\nThe large sample size gave the study high statistical power, which allowed researchers to confidently detect this meaningful effect\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Treatment Effect of 0.28 SD\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Why This Matters: Understanding Statistical Power\nThis example shows why statistical power is critical in research.\nEven if a program has a real, positive effect, as Balsakhi did, a study without enough power might miss it. Small or underpowered samples are more likely to produce inconclusive or misleading results.\nBecause this study was well-powered, it gave strong evidence that the tutoring program worked. If the sample had been smaller, the study might have wrongly concluded that there was no impact.\n\n💡 Bottom line: Statistical power helps researchers avoid false negatives and ensures that policy decisions are based on real, reliable evidence – not just chance.\n\nThis case shows how careful study design and sufficient power can lead to actionable insights, helping shape smarter education policies in low-resource settings.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concept 1\n\n\n\nThe larger the study sample, the more likely researchers are to estimate the true treatment effect of the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Size N=200: Wide estimate range\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Size N=2000: Narrow estimate range",

They show how likely different values of β̂ are, assuming a true treatment effect β.\n\n\n\nTwo overlapping normal distributions representing possible treatment effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concept 3\n\n\n\nA narrower distribution of estimates (β̂) increases the chances of detecting true effects. You can achieve this by: - Increasing the sample size (N) - Assigning roughly equal numbers to treatment and control (p ≈ 0.5) - Reducing outcome variance (σ²)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Effects Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nIf researchers repeated the same RCT many times, they wouldn’t get the exact same estimate every time. Instead, the estimated treatment effects (β̂) would follow a normal distribution:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta} \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\beta, \\sigma^2 / [Np(1-p)])\n\\]\n\nβ: True treatment effect\nσ²: Variance of the outcome\nN: Sample size\np: Proportion assigned to treatment (e.g., 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concept 4\n\n\n\nType I Error (α): Risk of a false positive - Usually set at 5% (α = 0.05) - This means there’s a 5% chance of incorrectly detecting an effect when there is none - A lower α reduces false positives—but increases the risk of missing real effects - Its complement (1−α) is known as the confidence level – how likely studies are to avoid a false positive - While 5% is standard, it can range from 1%-10% in research literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis Testing Framework\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether an effect is statistically significant, researchers use a hypothesis test. This is important because it helps control the risk of making a Type I error – incorrectly concluding that an effect exists when it actually does not, a “false positive.” By setting a significance level (α), researchers limit the probability of making this error and ensure findings are not due to random chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Null Hypothesis, H₀\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumes no effect exists, β = 0. This is the starting point for statistical testing and represents the default position that the intervention has no impact.\n\n\n\nStatistical hypothesis testing showing null and alternative distributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Alternative Hypothesis, H₁\n\n\n\n\n\nProposes existence of an effect, β ≠ 0. Can be one-sided, β &gt; 0 or β &lt; 0, or two-sided, β ≠ 0.\n\n\n\nEstimate the treatment effect (𝛽 ̂)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Critical Values Computation\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on chosen significance level α, typically uses α = 0.05. Forms rejection regions in the distribution and uses t-distribution or z-distribution.\n\n\n\nCritical Values\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Values - Fail To reject\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Values - Reject\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Effect Estimation and Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate estimated effect size β̂ and compare to critical values. Consider confidence intervals and assess statistical significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Statistical Decision\n\n\n\n\n\nReject H₀ if β̂ exceeds critical values. Fail to reject H₀ if β̂ falls within critical bounds. Consider practical significance and report p-values and confidence intervals.\n\n\n\nNo rejection of Ho\n\n\n\n\n\nRejection of Ho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concept 5\n\n\n\nType II Error (κ): Risk of a false negative\n\nκ: Probability of missing a real effect\nPower (1−κ): Probability of detecting a true effect (aim for ≥80%)\nLower α (false positive rate) increases κ (false negative rate)\nPower and sample size are directly related: higher power needs a larger sample",

    "text": "Developing a Survey Plan\nWrite your survey plan as you design your questionnaire and decide whether it should be electronic or paper-based. You will need to share your survey plan with others working with you like the Country Director, PIs, country level and HQ survey support staff.\nFor paper surveys, give a heads up to the in-house data entry staff as early as possible. If you have a data entry unit in your country or use a data entry company, make sure your timeline fits their schedule so you can get the data quickly after fieldwork finishes. The same applies for dedicated programming staff if your survey is digital.\nYour survey plan can work as a running document where you fill details as you determine them. It should include the following:\n\nQuestionnaire Development: piloting questionnaires, translation, back translation, who will be involved at these stages, where will you pilot the survey – consider not going to actual survey respondents but finding people similar—and how will you analyze the data.\nPersonnel: who do you need to hire for surveying and quality control and what are the payment structures for staff. When will you hire people – think about the structure and composition you want for your team. You might want to hire some senior people to help you with piloting the questionnaire and hiring other surveyors who will serve as team leaders/field managers when you start actual surveying. You might decide to go with a survey company. If you do, consider what they will take care of and what you will. Read the guide to deciding between a survey company and hiring your own team, and the quality control guide.\nTimeline for data collection: when will piloting the questionnaire happen, when will training happen, when will surveying start and finish. Read the section on timeline below.\nLogistics: how will you move teams across survey regions, transportation, accommodation, food etc. If you are surveying electronically, how you will charge, store and secure your devices. Read the section on logistics below.\nSurvey Tracking: how will you stay on top of the progress made in surveying, how many surveys should be completed per day, monitor data collection and keep track of which surveys are being checked.\nRespondent tracking: what information do you want to collect, who tracks hard to find respondents, how much time do you devote, how do you decide when to drop a respondent, what is your replacement plan. Read the guideline on tracking respondents.\nStorage: where will surveys or electronic devices be stored—Do you need a field office?\nTraining Surveyors: where will training happen, how long will it go on for, what should be on the training agenda, how will you incorporate as much field training as possible, how many surveyors do you want to recruit. Read the materials on training surveyors and creating a survey manual.\nWhat equipment and other items do you need to buy: gifts for respondents, any equipment for taking anthropometric measurements, other survey material such as stationery for surveyors. Read the section on survey materials below.\nYour time: You are responsible for the whole survey and there are several things happening simultaneously that require your attention. It might be a good idea to designate time for things—for example, Friday look at back check data, Monday go out to the field—so that you do not forget anything during data collection.\n\n\nTimeline\nWhile estimating when the survey will be complete is an inexact art, it is essential to do it well because data is often time-sensitive and must be collected while a program is running. Data collection must occur within a specific period to be comparable to others in the same survey or your budget restricts you to a long or short survey period. That means you need to plan realistically what your team can accomplish, learn immediately if you are falling behind your timeline and adapt quickly with a revised plan.\nSpecific plans vary according to the programs being evaluated, the survey, team structures, and geography. The core of your plan is deciding how many surveys you expect each person to complete each day. The following are some general principles that should guide this calculation:\n\nTraveling to Respondents: You need to develop a good sense of how long it’ll take to find a specific respondent. This may vary across the regions, districts or neighborhoods in your sample. Before fielding the survey, figure out which areas will be the most difficult to find respondents and which will be relatively easier. Consult maps with roads and anyone with local knowledge, from local partners to shop owners. Also, think about how long it’ll take surveyors to get to the survey area from their accommodation and include this in your calculation of the working day. It’s tempting to not include travel time in your work day, but you do this at your own peril. Travel time is one of the most common factors that delay a survey.\nFinding Hard to Find Respondents: Finding all respondents in a cluster often requires several attempts and needs to be factored into your expectations of how many surveys your team will perform each day. Identify what is the best time to find respondents in your survey sample- e.g., if it’s a period of heavy agricultural activity most people may be at their farms for some duration of the day and try to find out what time this might be. Finding respondents in the follow-up/endline survey will take more time than the baseline as some respondents may have moved and your team will need to sleuth out additional information to find them. Read the guide on Respondent Tracking.\nSurvey Time: From the piloting of the questionnaire, you should have a sense of how long it takes to complete a single questionnaire. Based on this estimate as well as travel and tracking time, set a target number of surveys to be completed per day by each surveyor. Keep in mind that during the initial days of the survey, most surveyors will not reach their target. However, it is advisable that this only be factored into your timeline and average daily return calculations, but not into the daily target you set for your team. Surveyors should be given target estimates based on what is expected to be completed per day after the initial slowness of data collection is over.\nHolidays: Be sure to factor in national and local holidays. Consult with partner staff about which holidays they follow and could affect respondent availability. Some locations have so many holidays it may seem impossible to work!\nTreatment/Control Balance: Finally, be sure that treatment and control respondents/areas are surveyed in a balanced manner. Don’t survey all the controls and then all the treatment, but rather try to survey them simultaneously and as evenly as possible over the survey period.\n\n\n\nLogistics\nAs a field RA, your job is to make sure everything happens when it is supposed to, which means you need to be a mean multitasker and be able to inspire the best out of your survey team. Delegating the logistics in large surveys to a survey company or in-country management teams reduces some of the management burden, but you will still need to verify proper planning and timely execution. If surveying is considered a low paying, low skilled job in your area it might not attract people who take the initiative to recognize whether they have everything they need to do their job. Think about building in accountability systems into your field plan to incentivize people to meet targets and tell you when they hit a roadblock in the field.\nIn general, when planning the movement of teams, start with easy places to survey. Surveyors generally take more time in the early days to reach their target number of respondents and working in villages that are close by or where you’ll be able to find respondents easily reduces stress on you and your team. If the survey launches in several regions of the country simultaneously, consider a phased start of surveying so you can spend time with each team as they launch to be able to put out fires and improve practices before the whole team starts surveying.\nHere are some things to consider when planning logistics:\n\nTransportation Methods: How will the teams travel to villages and sometimes even within villages? Will you give them a travel allowance and they organize their own transportation or will you need to organize a communal method? If you’re organizing, how many teams can fit in a minivan? Does every team need their own vehicle?\nDirections to survey locations: Maps may not always give you the most accurate directions to a village. How will you find villages? How will you make sure that it is the right village? Who is responsible for making sure the team is in the right location?\nAccommodation: Where will teams stay? Will they find their own accommodation or will you need to organize? Are there convenient accommodation options close to the villages you survey? If not, should you think about teams staying in villages? In this case, arrangements (mattresses, cooking equipment) will need to be organized. It is advisable for teams to stay together when they need to stay outside their home base. This allows you to make sure everyone arrives on time and coordinate evening meetings when the team comes back. If they make their own accommodation arrangements, consider imposing penalties for late arrivals because it slows down the whole team.\nFood: Where will people have their lunch? How long are they allowed to break on the field? Are there options in the village or will they need to travel far to find food? Encourage teams to pack their own food if this is the case.\nCommunicating with Local Authorities: You may need to get permission to survey from district officials. Print letters that can be given to officials- decide who will go meet them.\nFinding the right respondent: How will the surveyors a) find the respondent and b) make sure it’s the right respondent? One option is to send mobilizers (well-informed and trusted community members or leaders) before the survey team to find respondents and slot interview appointments so that the surveyors don’t waste time finding respondents.\nEquipment: how are you printing all survey materials? How will you distribute them to staff? For phone surveys, how are you distributing SIM cards? How are you managing the sign-in and sign-out of devices/tablets/phones? Is there any other equipment that enumerators need to complete surveys?\nProductivity: How many surveys should each enumerator strive to complete per day? How will they know which respondents to attempt on each working day?\nInternet access: For digital data collection in particular, you should consider what speed of internet is available and how reliable it is. You also need to think about whether the internet is sufficient for uploading the types of files that you have. For example, audio files require much more bandwidth than survey data. For remote areas, consider setting up a local area network at your field office, to enable analysis of collected data without connecting to the internet. SurveyCTO offline sync simplifies this process. Be sure that you have a plan for sending airtime to enumerators to conduct and send in surveys once they are completed. If you are offering airtime as a respondent gift, you should set up the system for sending to specific phone numbers.",

    "text": "Financial Plan\nManaging your finances is one of the biggest, hidden headaches of keeping your field team moving. How you’re going to get money to the team, when they will be paid and how much should definitely be part of your field plan. Here are a few things to consider when creating your financial plan:\n\nPayment Lag: Keep in mind that there is often a lag between when surveyors start work and they get paid. If you are paying surveyors per diems and transport allowance, this can be a problem if they are required to buy their own transportation fuel or food upfront. Consider providing these until they are paid, giving a start of project bonus or loan (which can be automatically deducted from their first payment). Failing to plan for this can slow the launch of a survey.\nPaying in Cash vs. Direct Deposit: Definitely discuss this decision with your in-country management team. In countries where you can deposit funds into bank accounts, remember that it can take a significant amount of time to withdraw money from a bank. If you’re paying per diems this way, it can lead to field delays and needs to be accounted for in your timeline. While cash may be easier to make happen logistically and result in few delays, it is also a major security risk. Make sure you have procedures in place to get the money safely from the bank and then hold your team accountable so you can de-incentivize them from embezzling funds and catch any money problems early.\nSending Airtime/Internet to Enumerators and Respondents: Create a system for sending internet to respondents if you are offering airtime as a respondent gift. Ideally, you should have someone in your office or give enumerators the ability to send airtime directly to a phone number. Enumerators must have enough internet to send in surveys or airtime to conduct surveys if they are conducting phone surveys.",

    "text": "Survey Materials\nMake field departure and return checklists of things people need to do before they go out into the field and close for the day. Consider pasting these procedures to your office on the door so people can check if they have everything they need before they head out.\nThe field leadership team, i.e. Team Leader, Field Managers, is responsible for making sure this is followed. You may want to consider creating tracking forms, sign in/out sheets to help hold them and the team accountable. This is especially important in electronic surveying as you want to be sure that equipment like phones, PDAs, and netbooks are well-taken care of and you can hold the right person accountable if one is lost.\n\nEquipment\nMany projects need to purchase equipment for the field office or to collect anthropomorphic measures such as height, weight, or health indicators. Many institutions require getting price quotes from three or more vendors, which is a good practice, and will help you develop your negotiating skills. You should take an inventory of your office equipment, including the condition, at the beginning and end of the survey period to make sure nothing is lost or damaged.\nFor all equipment going to the field, it is highly recommended to put serial numbers on each piece and have surveyors check them out and check them in regularly for inspection. These machines are often subjected to rough conditions, and depreciate quickly. One way to improve your data is to have surveyors record the serial number of the machine used for each survey. That will help you identify systematic errors in machines.\n\n\nGPS Units\nSome surveys use GPS (Global Positioning System) units to record GPS readings to aid in locating and verifying the right household in subsequent surveys. Often team leaders or people doing the census exercise are responsible for taking GPS readings to minimize the number of units required. Make sure you send them with additional batteries and budget for a few more GPS units than the people taking GPS readings to allow for units breaking on the field. Be sure to set the same coordinate format on all units before sending them to the field so you don’t have to convert them later.\nOne point to note about GPS readings is that they are helpful in finding respondents in subsequent surveys but may not be sufficient. Unless you have GPS units that are accurate to within 5 meters there is bound to be some confusion in subsequent surveys. Traditional tracking methods – such as hand-drawn maps, collecting phone numbers and contacts – should be used to complement the GPS readings and provide a secondary method to find respondents. These methods should not be abandoned simply because GPS readings are taken.",

    "text": "Tablets and phones\nIPA recommends buying devices from trusted brands such as Samsung or Google. It is important to buy sturdy cases to avoid breaking your devices. Many projects will find that extra battery packs are a necessity in the field. You should do field piloting of your devices to work out the kinks early on so you can budget for the necessary equipment when making your survey plan. You should also consider buying a gasoline or diesel generator if power is unreliable.\nIf you are conducting a phone survey, be sure that enumerators also have headphones, battery packs, and charger cables. If you are asking enumerators to use their own phones, SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards should be provided so enumerators are not using their own phone numbers.\n\nEquipment for surveyors\nYou will need to make sure that your team has all the basic equipment it needs for the field. This includes:\n\nBags and Folders: for surveyors to organize their questionnaire. Consider getting something durable and rain proof to protect equipment and/or questionnaires.\nUmbrellas/Rain Coats: If you’re asking your team to work through rainy season, this can help them persevere through a drizzle.\nStationery Items: include pencils, sharpeners and erasers and, potentially, a stapler per team.\nID cards for surveyors: This helps surveyors establish credibility when surveying. T-shirts and hats with the IPA logo can also help.\n\n\n\nRespondent gifts/ incentives\n\nChoosing gifts\nOften surveys give the respondent gifts or incentives to compensate them for their time. Some surveys have given money but it is recommended that it be used rarely and preferably only when you are taking someone’s time when they would otherwise be working. Sometimes the money for respondent gifts is used to play games eliciting risk aversion, however, this runs the risk of some respondents feeling under-compensated and moreover surveyors might like to be nice to respondents and let them “win” coin tosses.\nGenerally, you do not want to choose a gift that is extremely valuable to the survey respondent. This can run into issues with ethics since it is important to avoid having undue influence when a respondent feels they have no choice but to be interviewed because of the incentive involved. Because of this, survey gifts must be approved by your IRB.\nSome of the items that have been given by past IPA projects include sugar, cooking oil, washing soap bars, pencils, and sharpeners for school kids. Some projects have also given IPA T-shirts and IPA key chains but be careful with these. In a project in Ghana, farmers were given IPA T-shirts and some farmers wanted to form an association of IPA respondents in a village!\nItems for the household are a safe bet because they are useful no matter which respondent receives the gift. Some of these items could be bulky, making it a struggle to carry them on the field. You need to factor in how the team will carry these items on the field, since spillage or leaking may damage surveys or expensive equipment if they are carried in the same bag. One common gift phone cards since are easy to cart around, and they facilitate phone back checks or tracking later on. With all gifts, and phone cards in particular, the challenge is to set up a system to verify that respondents received their gifts and they were not taken by the surveyors. Consider including a question in your back check survey about receiving the gift or a shorter phone follow up.\n\n\nTreatment v. Control Gifts\nIf you are working on a project where a loan or capital is given as one of the treatments, you may want to consider a) how you present the cash to the respondents and b) a nice gift for the control group as well to maintain good relations. It can be hard to maintain a good relationship with control respondents when they hear that others participating in the study received 100GHC and they did not. No matter how many times you explain it is random, like winning the lottery, you will still have some disgruntled respondents. Projects have given control groups nicer gifts from flashlights to nice sets of stationery to compensate for the disappointment of not receiving a big prize. Another thing to consider is how the gift is presented. You may want to allow respondents to rip open an envelope or scratch off a scratch card to heighten the feeling of winning a prize, rather than simply being given a gift for their time.",

The DMS assists you with the following functionality:\n\nCreating folders and do-files: Automatically creates a folder structure, Stata files and documentation, including for projects with multiple surveys—creates standardized folder structure, input files, do-files and readme files\nDeciding which quality checks are important to your project: A simple global do-file with a detailed description of the different check features as well as a section to turn on and off specific checks based on your own needs—backchecks, field comments, survey tracking, duplicates, missing values, outliers, text audits, and more\nDe-duplicating: Automatically flags all duplicates, and provides a summary of the differences of each duplicate group. Also, saves a new de-duplicated clean dataset so high-frequency checks can run.\nChecking and reporting on data quality: Runs high-frequency checks to flag issues with data quality. The system asks you to identify important checks and variables in the global do-file and Excel-based inputs sheets, then automatically generates reports for interpretation and follow-up actions to improve data quality.\nChecking and reporting on inconsistencies in the dataset: Compares and reports on the differences in responses in the Survey and Backchecks datasets.\nCorrections to the dataset: Includes an easy-to-use excel-based tool for making and logging changes to data including replacements and values, dropping of observations and flagging HFC outliers values as correct.\nReporting on enumerator performance: Generates enumerator reports with indicators of enumerator productivity and other general enumerator performance including Don’t Know/Refuse/Missing/Other specify responses rate and summary statistics by specified variables.\nReporting on survey progress: Generates progress reports on survey completion, by day/week/month and by a customizable filter variable—progress reports by region, district, village, treatment status",

Before starting any analyses, consider whether you need to collect and retain PII. Most analyses do not require PII. Typically, researchers use PII only to link data from different sources, multiple rounds of a longitudinal study,or for analyses that rely on geographic location data.\nIf PII is not necessary for the analysis, then split it from the data immediately. Usually, you do not need to share PII with principal investigators. Instead, anonymize the data immediately using the split_pii Stata program and share only the anonymized data with principal investigators. You can download this program through the Statistical Software Components—SSC—archive.\nPII includes information that researchers can use to specifically identify an individual. Due to the nature of research IPA conducts, staff manage PII of research study participants. Research teams must not release this information to external individuals, usually including principal investigators and users who access publicly accessible materials, such as from IPA’s Data Repository. Therefore, staff need access to strategies to remove this data to ensure the safety of research subjects.",

They involve re-contacting a subset of respondents to administer a mini-survey with selected questions from the original questionnaire. The responses are then compared to the initial survey to identify discrepancies, assess surveyor performance, and evaluate the robustness of the survey instrument. Backchecks help hold surveyors accountable and improve data quality by verifying how questions are asked and detecting potential errors in data collection.\nThis critical step in data quality enables researchers to monitor both the performance of the survey team and the questionnaire in the field.

For CATI surveys, back check more than 10%.\nTiming: Every team and every surveyor should be back checked as soon as possible, ideally within the first week of surveying, and regularly after that. Aggressively back check during the first few weeks, then reduce to 10% for the rest of the surveying phase.\nFrequency: Each enumerator should be checked at least once per week throughout the survey.\nMissing and Replacement Respondents: Include a proportional number of missing and replacement respondents in the back check sample.\nRandom Selection: The selection of households for back checks must be random. Stratify the sampling when appropriate.\nMultiple Versions: Use multiple versions of the back check questionnaire, covering the entire survey. Each version should include a minimum of 10 questions or 10% of the total survey instrument.\nSurvey Length: Keep the back check survey significantly shorter than the main survey.

Multiple analyses conducted by IPA staff have shown that the time elapsed since the original survey is the most common statistically significant predictor of the number of errors in back checks across projects and contexts. The back check team should be ready to begin fieldwork on day one of the survey period.\nCraft your back check plan at the same time as your survey work plan and maintain it as a running document, updating details as the survey work plan evolves. This ensures that at the end of the survey, you have an accurate description of how the back checks were carried out and any actions taken.\nWhen developing your plan, address the following questions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will you conduct your back checks? Can you do them in person?\nHow many surveys will you back check? 10% or more? Will you change the percentage during the survey period?\nHow will you spread them across your enumeration areas, surveyors, and survey period?\nHow many questionnaires will you use? Multiple questionnaires are optimal, especially for longer, more complex surveys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudget\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much money do you have for your back check?

Ideally, within 1-2 days. One week is the maximum.\nHow big will your back check team be, and how will you train them?\nAre there enough back checkers to check all enumerators each week? Do you need to hire more back checkers during the first few weeks of surveying?\nHow will the team get to the field? If conducting back checks by phone, do you have enough phones?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis and Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will you define and calculate errors?\nHow will you deal with discrepancies?

This method involves initiating communication from your profile, prompting user engagement. This method is different from waiting for user-initiated communication, where you will have an open chat and you don’t have a specific target sample.\nThe first step to start the process is creating a “cases file.” This file is a dataset with participants’ phone numbers and any additional information relevant to your survey. If you consider including personalized messages or details to populate survey fields, you should include this information as dataset variables. Another recommendation is to incorporate an identifier to keep track of submissions without using any PII for effective tracking.\nFollow these steps to construct your cases file:\n\nThe file should be in xlsx format. Use Stata, Python, R, or your preferred statistical software to create this document to reduce manual input errors.\nEnsure the Excel file includes a column or variable named “Number,” with a capital N, structured as “whatsapp:+” followed by the phone number and country identifier, as depicted in the image.\nName other variables according to your preference. If numeric values are present, store them as text to prevent Excel from altering them.\nStore the “cases” dataset in a secure and encrypted folder on your computer to ensure data security.\n\nYour cases file should look like this:\n\n\n\nCases file example",

    "section": "What are qualitative interviews?",
    "text": "What are qualitative interviews?\nInterviews are a qualitative method of gathering information through a formal dialog between two people—the interviewer and the interviewee—guided by a specific research goal. Unlike conventional conversations, which involve symmetrical communication and relationship between the interlocutors1, a qualitative interview uses a structured approach. In this setting, the interviewee permits the interviewer to direct the conversation and guide the dialog in accordance with the objectives of the study. The interviewee thus becomes the primary source of information.2\nThis collection method offers flexibility. While there is a script or a list of specific topics to investigate, the interviewer may follow emerging topics or delve deeper into particular aspects according to the interviewee’s answers. The structure of this data collection technique can vary widely. At one end of the spectrum are highly structured interviews, which follow a defined sequence of topics and number of questions. At the other end are semi-structured interviews, where the moderator intuitively delves into the topics of interest.3 The research objectives and the type of data needed influence the structure of the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData from qualitative interviews\n\n\n\nQualitative interviews seek in-depth answers and the person’s interpretive perspective. In general, interviews have some advantages for certain profiles in contrast to focus groups. These include experts in different fields, populations that experienced traumatic events, persons deprived of liberty, geographically dispersed populations, and people with disabilities. Moreover, the types of data gathered through interviews can include:\n\nFeelings and Emotions: Understanding the emotional responses and feelings of the interviewee.\nOpinions and Perspectives: Gaining insights into the interviewee’s viewpoints and beliefs.\nExperiences and Narratives: Collecting detailed accounts of the interviewee’s personal experiences.\nKnowledge and Expertise: Gathering information from experts or individuals with specialized knowledge.\n\n\n\nIn-depth interviews help to learn about the interviewees’ feelings, opinions, perspectives, beliefs, and experiences. The interviewees express themselves in their own words and in an active way, pointing out their point of view on the issues raised by the interviewer. This collection method works well for discussing complex or sensitive topics that some people may be reluctant to discuss in a group setting.4 Qualitative interviews provide unique insights from participants’ experiences and knowledge, translated into detailed narratives and descriptions that reveal how people interpret their experiences and the world around them.",

    "text": "Planning a qualitative interview\nProper preparation is essential for the success of an interview, ensuring that the research activity meets its field data collection objectives. This section provides detailed guidance on the planning steps that should be undertaken before conducting an interview.\n\n\nStructure your team\n\n\nDuring qualitative interviews, the fieldwork team includes a moderator and a facilitator. The facilitator’s participation is crucial to support logistical and note-taking processes. While budget restrictions may sometimes require the moderator to work individually. If you have a facilitator, it is important that you identify the functions they will perform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen not to have a facilitator\n\n\n\nWhen an interview involves sensitive or personal issues, such as when the interviewee is hesitant to share intimate details, the interviewer’s approach can significantly impact the conversation. For example, if a facilitator does not value the importance of mental health, this may become evident in how they take notes during an interview about traumatic experiences related to mental health.\n\n\n\n\nRecognize the skills of the field team\n\n\nThe quality of data produced during qualitative research activities relates to the skills of the moderator and facilitator.5 These competencies, outlined in Table 1, enable teams to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within qualitative data.6 While these skills are typically developed through years of study and practice, field teams often consist of individuals from multidisciplinary backgrounds. These individuals have varying levels of experience. Regardless of experience level, it is important to review and discuss these skills with your team to identify possible gaps and opportunities for improvement.\nCurrently, there are no standardized metrics to measure the prevalence of these skills among qualitative fieldwork moderators. Therefore, teams should view the skills in Table 1 as a resource for reference and reflection. Ensuring that everyone on the team understands how these competencies contribute to engaging with the population is essential for collecting high-quality information.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Skills of the field team conducting interviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkill\nDescription\nWhy is this skill relevant?\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect with participant’s realities and experiences. Helps to create a relationship of trust and respect with the participants. Seeks to avoid generalizations and stereotypes that may arise from preconceptions or external influences such as previous studies. Enhances understanding of participants’ situations without resorting to pity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. Contributes to obtaining deeper responses from participants. Enables exploration of emerging themes during data collection. Helps detect and validate patterns observed in the field.\n\n\nSelf-awareness and reflexivity\nThe field team’s ability to continuously reflect on how their presence, background, and assumptions influence data collection, interpretation, and analysis. This ongoing self-reflection ensures that the qualitative field team is mindful of its impact on the research process and the participants.\nHelps maintain ethics in the researcher-participant relationship. Facilitates understanding of personal limitations in connecting with participants. Aids in developing strategies to overcome communication barriers and create an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.\n\n\nHeterogeneity*\nThe field team’s ability to represent and reflect the diversity within the group being studied. This skill involves recognizing and documenting the differences and variations among individuals or subgroups during qualitative research, typically applied during the data analysis phase.\nContributes to challenging generalized and simplistic patterns. Ensures that data reflect both common and atypical experiences. Demonstrates the field team’s ability to identify, recognize, and document heterogeneity in the population studied.\n\n\nPalpability\nThe field team’s ability to provide detailed descriptions in their field notes or diaries, making the data tangible and clear. This involves avoiding abstract descriptions and, instead, offering vivid accounts that allow the research team to visualize and understand participants’ experiences and contexts.\nReliable findings are supported by specific details that depict the events and situations studied. Helps to avoid abstraction in the data, grounding conclusions in concrete evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan logistics activities\n\n\nLogistical activities play a crucial role in the success of interviews. Careful planning ensures that all necessary elements are in place to conduct interviews effectively. The following list presents general activities that should happen before implementing interviews. However, this list could be more comprehensive based on the specific research needs of the fieldwork. Ensure you cover all critical aspects to complete your research activities successfully. Based on experience in qualitative field operations across various contexts, the IPA team has identified key practices that guide research teams in effective planning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule Participants\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule interviews at least one week in advance. Send reminders before the activity.\nDuring scheduling, tell participants about the objective, scope, leading organization, and confidentiality of the interview to align expectations and avoid confusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the location of the Interview\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the location and conditions of the meeting site. Remember that it is important to schedule a place whose location does not pose a risk to the participant or the team.\nThis place should have appropriate seating and furniture so the participant feels comfortable during the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare essential materials\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have all the necessary materials for the session. This includes incentives, refreshments/snacks, attendance sheet, recording equipment, and batteries.\nTest the audio equipment in advance to ensure clear recording of the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the strategies for taking notes\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a note-taking strategy to identify topics not recorded in the audio, capture nonverbal communication from the participant, and document the session in case the participant does not consent to recording. The facilitator supports this task.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign and study the script\n\n\nUnderstanding the research questions is crucial for effective interviewing. The script is a guiding tool that helps keep the conversation within the research objectives. However, each dialog is unique, so it’s important to study the script to adapt to the conversation’s context without losing sight of the main topics.\nDuring the script preparation, you should identify the main questions to address the research objectives and strategically use follow-up and probing questions to delve deeper into relevant issues7:\n\nMain questions: These are the questions that guide the interview. They are defined beforehand and specified in the script.\nFollow-up questions: These are used to obtain more details and depth on specific topics, concepts, or events mentioned by the person being interviewed\n\nWhat do you think would happen if [situation]?\nCould you give an example of [topic]?\nHow did you decide to do it that way?\nHow did you determine what was important?\nHow did you conclude what you are telling me?\n\nProbing questions: They help validate what the participant is saying and also encourage the dynamic flow throughout the conversation.\n\nIs this what you said [statement]?\nDid I understand you when you said [statement]?\nWhat is another way you could [action]?\nDid I paraphrase accurately what you said?\n\n\nThis will allow you to obtain the essential information directly related to the study’s objectives. It also allows you to explore additional areas that can provide context and enrich the understanding of the data. It is also important to understand the research goals and main questions. It will allow you to go beyond the questionnaire and approach questions or dimensions of the problem that were not initially known.",

    "text": "Conducting a qualitative interview\nTo begin the interview, always start by introducing yourself and the objective of the session. Read the informed consent form. Ensure that the interviewee understands the purpose of the activity, its confidentiality, and the potential risks and benefits of participating in it. Use simple words that the interviewee understands.\nThen, emphasize the data security measures your team is taking to keep the information confidential. This will help the interviewee feel confident that they can discuss their experiences and will be heard.\nCreate a comfortable and calm atmosphere. Throughout the activity, it is essential to maintain this atmosphere that allows the interviewee’s opinions to be spontaneous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole of the facilitator in this phase\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that recording equipment is working throughout the activity.\nAsk counter-questions to the interviewee.\nVerify that no relevant topics are left out.\nAssist if the interviewee’s emotions prevent them from continuing with the interview. For example, in actions such as offering a glass of water or proposing a pause.\nTake notes of the entire activity, especially the interviewee’s nonverbal reactions.\nSupport the moderator in time management.\n\n\n\n\nBeing an effective interviewer?\nThe interviewer guides the discussion and ensures the flow of the dialog with the interviewee while focusing on the relevant issues. An effective interviewer not only facilitates a natural discussion, but also creates an environment where the participant feels comfortable and safe expressing their opinions openly, without fear of criticism or judgment. Table 2 presents skills of effective qualitative interviewers.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Desirable skills of an interviewer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkill\nDescription\nWhy is this skill relevant?\n\n\n\n\nProvide for participants’ well-being\nCreate safe and comfortable environment. Prioritize interviewee’s well-being, respect and value. Adapt environment and rhythm to reduce stress/discomfort.\nHelps establish trust and encourages open dialog. Shows respect for participant’s comfort and dignity. Body language that promotes trust is essential.\n\n\nBe empathetic\nExpress empathy and validate interviewee’s emotions to create atmosphere of openness and sincerity. Practice effective communication.\nCreates atmosphere of trust. Helps interview flow well. Express gratitude for participation. Match facial expressions and tone to emotions shared.\n\n\nUse few interruptions\nAvoid abrupt interruptions. Guide conversation back on track subtly when needed. Let interviewee establish narrative order.\nRespects participant as main source of information. Allows natural flow of conversation while maintaining focus. Can use techniques like paraphrasing to redirect gently.\n\n\nListen actively8\nShow full attention and interest. Consider both verbal and nonverbal communication. Ask thoughtful follow-up questions.\nDemonstrates respect and engagement. Helps ensure accurate understanding. Allows deeper exploration of topics through appropriate follow-up.\n\n\nAvoid value judgments\nMaintain neutral, inquiring stance. Don’t express agreement/disagreement that could influence responses.\nPrevents biasing responses. Keeps focus on participant’s perspective. Use neutral phrases to encourage elaboration.\n\n\nTrain your memory\nDevelop ability to remember key details for meaningful connections during conversation.\nEnables better follow-up questions. Helps maintain conversation flow. Allows tracking of important themes.\n\n\nUse silences constructively\nHandle silences constructively to allow reflection time. Avoid filling silence with filler words.\nGives participants time to think. Shows respect for responses. Allows natural pace of conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential challenges in a qualitative interview\nThere are situations that could take place during a qualitative interview that you should prepare for. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncomplete, superficial or monosyllabic responses\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some interviews, particularly at the beginning, the interviewee may be shy or inhibited, which prevents them from providing detailed and in-depth answers to the questions posed. To identify an incomplete or superficial response, you can look for aspects such as:\n\nanswers that are too general and do not provide specific details\nanswers that are limited to one or a few words\nhaste in answering without going into detail.\n\nInvest time at the beginning of the activity to build rapport with the interviewee before addressing more in-depth questions. This initial trust may encourage fuller responses. You can use “icebreaker” activities to do this. Ask open-ended questions that require a more elaborate response and prepare follow-up questions to provide more details on initial responses. Ask for clarification by using counter-questions like “How did you feel about this?” or “What was your reaction when this happened?” to encourage more detailed answers. Explain how your answers make a valuable contribution to the study or project. Ask easy-to-understand questions in simple language and rephrase some if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional overflow from participants\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants may experience intense emotions during an interview, which can be challenging to manage due to the personal nature of discussions. Be empathetic and avoid abrupt changes in discussion topics during emotionally charged moments. Allow participants to express their emotions while guiding the discussion constructively. Offer the option to pause or continue based on the participant’s comfort. If emotions are overwhelming, take a short break and show support. Provide relevant mental health care information per research protocols. Ensure the field team has training in psychological first aid if sensitive issues will be discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFatigue\n\n\n\n\n\nFatigue can affect both the interviewee and interviewer, leading to a loss of concentration, energy, and quality in responses. This may result in missed questions or premature assumptions. Limit the interview length and be flexible with scheduling if you notice signs of fatigue. Ensure the interview environment is comfortable, with good lighting and low noise. Schedule breaks during the interview if necessary, or continue at another time if needed. Consider active breaks or refreshments to help rejuvenate participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeviation from the central theme\n\n\n\n\n\nConversations may deviate from the interview’s objectives, requiring the moderator to tactfully redirect the discussion while balancing the exploration of valuable but off-topic insights. Direct the conversation subtly and without abruptly interrupting the interviewee to return to the main topic. Establish clear objectives at the beginning. Before starting the interview, explain the objectives and topics to be covered so that the interviewee is clear about the necessary focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHostile interviewee\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interviewee may dominate the conversation with aggressive or derogatory language, creating a tense atmosphere. Prepare some key concepts about the topic that can help you respond confidently to the interviewee’s objections or challenges. In the event of verbal or other kind of aggression, end the interview, thanking the participant for their time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon interview mistakes\nWhen conducting qualitative interviews, avoid some mistakes so that the research activity, objectives, and the integrity of the person being interviewed are protected. Some mistakes are described here:\n\n\n\nCommon mistakes made when conducting interviews",

To wrap up the working session, it is recommended to:\n\nProvide space for reflection in which the interviewee can express comments, suggestions, or questions about the discussion\nExpress gratitude to the participants for their time and willingness to participate, emphasizing the importance of their opinions and the information they provided to the study\nSecure the data by prioritizing the safe storage of the recording and notes from the session.\n\nIt is also important to start working on the interview notes as soon as possible once it has been completed because if too much time passes between field activities and developing analysis, there is a risk of accumulating information and losing the opportunity to enrich the study research team insights.\n\nDocument Research Activities\nAt the end of the interview, it is important to document the information obtained in detail. How this documentation is done is a decision linked to the research design and researchers determine this before fieldwork begins. Examples of products you can use for this purpose are:\n\nFull transcripts of the discussions\nDetailed notes taken during the research activity\nField notes\nField diaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nThe lack of initial documentation products risks all information processing components and, thus, the quality of the data obtained.\n\n\nInformation should be recorded as soon as the interview concludes, to prevent the loss of crucial details. This immediate action is vital to the research process. In addition, the products derived from the focus group must follow information storage protocols, which may include anonymization and encryption to avoid compromising the confidentiality of participants.",

In the case of virtual interviews, ask the participant to use a camera during the activity.\n\n\nConnectivity problems\nConnectivity problems include situations that may cause people to interrupt their participation in the interview.\nDuring the scheduling, validate the participants’ connection difficulties; if they require it, make internet recharges. Avoid that the research activity generates connectivity costs for the participants. If necessary, consider interviewing in person.\n\n\nFatigue due to constant use of screens\nFatigue associated with prolonged screen use or time on the phone can affect the concentration of both the interviewer and the interviewee.\nPlan breaks during lengthy interviews. Limit the duration of each session to a reasonable time, approximately one hour. Plan several sessions if necessary.\n\n\nUsers multitasking\nThe person being interviewed may perform other tasks while participating. This may affect their participation in the activity.\nSuggest that the interviewee have their camera turned on. During scheduling, remember that the interview is an activity that involves full attention to listening to others, and engagement with the questions.\n\n\nConfidentiality\nSome interviewees may carry out the activity in spaces shared with family members and acquaintances. Depending on the sensitivity of the topics, this situation may place participants in uncomfortable or risky situations.\nAdvise interviewees on how to select an ideal space to have the interview.

    "text": "What is a focus group?\nFocus groups are one of the most widely used techniques in social research, particularly within qualitative studies. This method involves creating a discussion space where participants engage in an in-depth conversation about one or more topics.1 Focus groups represent an artificially configured environment whose main goal is to gather information on the interaction among participants. This includes exploring their perceptions, opinions, and attitudes toward specific topics.2\nUnlike individual interviews that capture personal perspectives in isolation, focus groups reveal how opinions form, evolve, and develop through social interaction. They are particularly valuable when you need to understand community norms, examine areas of consensus or disagreement, or explore how people collectively make meaning of experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus groups with migrant populations\n\n\n\nIn a focus group with Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, several common perceptions about the healthcare system emerged. While some participants acknowledged the accessibility of essential medical services as an advantage of the Colombian system, others expressed concerns about the quality of care, long wait times, and challenges in accessing specialized services, particularly due to their migratory status. The group dynamics revealed how participants validated each other’s experiences, creating a more comprehensive picture than individual interviews might have provided.\n\n\nIn a typical focus group, a moderator leads the discussion. This person ensures active interaction among participants. The moderator’s role is to ask questions that stimulate discussion, guide the conversation to gather valuable insights, and build trust with the participants. This trust is crucial to making participants feel comfortable expressing themselves freely, ensuring the discussion remains productive and focused on relevant topics. Focus groups allow researchers to gather data on how participants communicate, share their opinions and experiences, and react to the contributions of others.\nFocus group dynamics allow researchers to identify what information participants censor or encourage among themselves.3 Group conversation does not necessarily imply consensus. During the conversation, participants may misinterpret each other’s accounts, question themselves, and attempt to persuade each other.4 Disagreement is also a key component of this collection technique, as it allows exploring the diversity of opinions and the reasons behind participants’ beliefs and attitudes. Overall, focus groups make it possible to identify both shared perceptions and divergences among participants on a specific topic.",

    "text": "Planning a focus group\nProper preparation is essential for the success of focus groups, ensuring that the research activity meets its field data collection objectives. This section provides detailed guidance on the planning steps that should be undertaken before conducting a focus group.\n\n\nStructure your team\n\n\nIdeally, focus group teams should consist of at least two roles: a moderator and a facilitator. The moderator’s primary responsibility is to lead the discussion during the focus group, ensuring that the conversation remains on track and that all participants engage actively. The facilitator handles logistical activities such as setting up recording equipment, providing refreshments and incentives, setting up the space, as well as, taking notes. It is crucial to clearly define and assign these roles in advance to ensure a smooth execution of the focus group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudget vs. quality trade-offs\n\n\n\nIf budget constraints prevent hiring a facilitator, it is important to recognize that this could negatively impact the quality of the activity and the data collected. Overburdening the moderator with both discussion and logistical duties may compromise their ability to maintain participant focus and engagement. Researchers should be aware of these potential drawbacks when planning qualitative data collection without a dedicated facilitator.\n\n\n\n\nRecognize the skills of the field team\n\n\nThe quality of data produced during qualitative research activities relates to the skills of the moderator and facilitator. These competencies, outlined in Table 1, enable teams to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within qualitative data. While these skills are typically developed through years of study and practice, field teams often consist of individuals from multidisciplinary backgrounds with varying levels of experience. Regardless of experience level, it is important to review and discuss these skills with your team to identify possible gaps and opportunities for improvement.\nCurrently, there are no standardized metrics to measure the prevalence of these skills among qualitative fieldwork moderators. Therefore, teams should view the skills in Table 1 as a resource for reference and reflection. Ensuring that everyone on the team understands how these competencies contribute to engaging with the population is essential for collecting high-quality information.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Skills of field staff conducting focus groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkill\nDescription\nWhy is this skill relevant?\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect with participant’s realities and experiences. Helps to create a relationship of trust and respect with the participants. Seeks to avoid generalizations and stereotypes that may arise from preconceptions or external influences such as previous studies. Enhances understanding of participants’ situations without resorting to pity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. Contributes to obtaining deeper responses from participants. Enables exploration of emerging themes during data collection. Helps in detecting and validating patterns observed in the field.\n\n\nSelf-awareness and reflexivity\nThe field team’s ability to continuously reflect on how their presence, background, and assumptions influence data collection, interpretation, and analysis. This ongoing self-reflection ensures that the qualitative field team is mindful of its impact on the research process and the participants.\nHelps maintain ethics in the researcher-participant relationship. Facilitates understanding of personal limitations in connecting with participants. Aids in developing strategies to overcome communication barriers and create an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nThe field team’s ability to represent and reflect the diversity within the group being studied. This skill involves recognizing and documenting the differences and variations among individuals or subgroups during qualitative research, typically applied during the data analysis phase.\nContributes to challenging generalized and simplistic patterns. Ensures that data reflect both common and atypical experiences. Demonstrates the field team’s ability to identify, recognize, and document heterogeneity in the population studied.\n\n\nPalpability\nThe field team’s ability to provide detailed descriptions in their field notes or diaries, making the data tangible and clear. This involves avoiding abstract descriptions and, instead, offering vivid accounts that allow the research team to visualize and understand participants’ experiences and contexts.\nThe palpable field notes and diaries are accompanied by textual quotations, images, or other audiovisual resources that show events, situations, and actors that support the research findings. Reliable findings are supported by specific details that clearly depict the events and situations studied. Helps to avoid abstraction in the data, grounding conclusions in concrete evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan the logistics of your focus group\n\n\nLogistical activities are important to ensure the correct implementation of focus groups. Careful logistical planning ensures that all necessary elements are in place to carry out the activities, participants receive timely scheduling, and all fieldwork details remain clear. Based on the experience of conducting qualitative field operations in various contexts, the IPA Colombia team has identified several key practices that are essential for the logistical preparation of a focus group:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule Participants\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule activities and participants at least one week in advance. Send reminders before the activity.\nDuring scheduling, tell participants about the objective, scope, leading organization, and confidentiality of the focus group to align expectations and avoid confusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the location of the focus group\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the location and conditions of the meeting site. Remember that it is important to schedule a place whose location does not pose a risk to the participants or the team.\nThis place should have the necessary furniture (chairs and tables) so that participants feel comfortable and can interact with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare essential materials\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have all the necessary materials for the session. This includes incentives (if applicable), refreshments/snacks, attendance list, recording equipment, and batteries.\nTest the audio equipment in advance to ensure clear recording and facilitate the group dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the strategies for taking notes\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a note-taking strategy to: identify topics not recorded in the audio, capture nonverbal interactions among participants, and document the session in case participants do not consent to recording. The facilitator supports this task.\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that there is no particular order/progression to these activities. We suggest the sequencing presented above, though it may change according to the context in which you conduct the focus groups. The listed activities exclude logistical tasks that the field and research team had to undertake to ensure the feasibility of conducting research activities, such as guaranteeing a space, contacting leaders, purchasing materials, etc. You should make a comprehensive list of the critical aspects to ensure the success of your qualitative data collection at different levels. As fieldwork approaches, consult the issues previously mentioned.\n\n\nDesign and study the script\n\n\nThe discussion script is a support tool that seeks to guide the conversation during the focus group according to the research objectives. It contains open-ended questions and topics designed to encourage reflection and discussion. You should study the script several times before the activity so that you will be able to explore new topics without losing sight of the objectives of the session. During this process of studying the script, identify:\n\nThe objective of the research activity.\nThe logical order of the focus group guide.\nPossible words or expressions that may confuse the participants so that you have time to change them to more understandable ones.\n\nWhen you know the topics to explore in detail, the script serves as a reminder during the talk. This allows more flexible and deeper conversations while maintaining focus on research objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe role of the facilitator\n\n\n\nIn addition to understanding the script, the facilitator must also understand the research questions of the project. This will allow them to probe beyond the guide and see, during the execution of the activity, possible questions or dimensions of the problem that were not known when the script was developed.",

    "section": "Conducting a focus group",
    "text": "Conducting a focus group\nWhen initiating a focus group, always start by introducing yourself, explaining the role of each member of the work team, and the overall dynamics of the session. Read the informed consent, ensuring all participants clearly understand the purpose of the activity and the potential risks and benefits of their participation. During this process, emphasize the confidentiality and anonymity of the information collected during the focus group. The moderator should explicitly obtain the participants’ authorization to record the session. Throughout the activity, create a comfortable and calm environment that allows participants to express their opinions freely and without censorship. To maintain a favorable atmosphere, show interest, cordiality, and respect for all interventions. Maintain an attitude of curiosity, even when topics extend beyond the planned scope or when opinions differ from yours.\n\nBeing an effective moderator\nTable 2 presents key principles to moderate focus groups. 5 The moderator plays a key role guiding the discussion, ensuring equal participation from all members, and keeping the conversation focused on relevant topics. An effective moderator facilitates a smooth and natural discussion, creating an environment where participants feel comfortable and safe to express their opinions openly, without fear of criticism or judgment. The moderator also manages potentially challenging group dynamics, ensuring that all participants have equal opportunities to contribute, and preventing any one participant from dominating the conversation. Other key responsibilities of an effective moderator include:\n\nEnsuring the recording equipment works throughout the activity.\nTaking comprehensive notes on the entire activity, particularly focusing on participants’ interactions and nonverbal reactions.\nEnsuring that the seating arrangement of the participants is appropriate for effective communication.\nProviding logistical support to the moderator by delivering refreshments and incentives (if applicable) and attending to the specific needs of participants, such as assisting visually impaired individuals or accommodating participants with children.\nSupporting the moderator in managing the session’s timing.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Principles of focus group moderation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nShow interest in participants\nAs a moderator, show respect and genuine interest in each participant’s contributions. Recognize that everyone has valuable knowledge, regardless of their education level, experience or background. Acknowledge contributions with expressions such as “Thank you for sharing that” or “That is an interesting point.” Address participants by their first name or their chosen pseudonym.\n\n\nAvoid assumptions\nDo not assume that the concepts or ideas expressed by the participants are clear. Avoid taking for granted the meaning of any idea, concept, or expression. For example: In a focus group with Venezuelan migrants, the expression “chamo” comes up. If you do not know this word, you should ask the participants directly what they are referring to with that word.\n\n\nGenerate empathy with participants\nGenerate an empathetic connection with focus group attendees. This helps them feel safe and valued when sharing emotions and experiences. A non-judgmental environment helps participants feel more comfortable speaking openly. Repeat or summarize participants’ comments to show that you understand their perspectives. Be patient. Do not rush the answers. Allow participants to take their time to think and respond.\n\n\nBe a moderator, not a participant\nThe moderator’s role is to guide the conversation, not to be part of it or share personal views. Some moderators assume that sharing personal experiences will encourage a greater exchange of ideas among participants. However, this practice can induce bias and affect the conversation’s overall flow.\n\n\nBe prepared to listen to different opinions and control your reactions\nThe moderator is not impartial, no matter how hard they try. It is important to identify your own biases and seek to contain personal assessments of the various opinions that may come from the participants. Avoid making value judgments about the testimonies and responses of the attendees. Be mindful of your reactions. Even small responses like nodding or giving short positive feedback such as “I think so too” or “You are right” can inadvertently influence the discussion. These reactions can induce social desirability bias, potentially altering the participants’ responses and the overall dynamics of the discussion.\n\n\nUse your talents\nIdentify your talents and use those that build trust and encourage conversation among participants. Make a list of your skills and talents. Think about what you do well and how these talents can be useful in the context of a focus group.\n\n\nAsk follow-up questions\nAsking follow-up questions allows for a deeper exploration of participant’s responses. This is essential to understand not only what people think, but why they think the way they do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential challenges during a focus group\nThere are situations that could take place during a focus group that you should be prepared for. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional overflow from participants\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging emotions can be one of the most complex challenges during a focus group, especially when discussions touch on intense or personal topics. Allow participants to express their emotions, but guide them constructively. Ask how they feel and why, and look for ways to channel those emotions into the discussion. If a person is emotionally affected by an event, ask them if they wish to continue the activity and remind them that participation is voluntary. If emotions disrupt the session, take a short break and show understanding and support. In accordance with research protocols, provide relevant mental health care resources that may be useful for the participants. If the focus group sessions address sensitive issues, the field team should have a course or training on psychological first aid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResistance to recording\n\n\n\n\n\nSome participants may not agree with the recording of their testimonies. If this happens, consider the following recommendations. If this is the case, emphasize confidentiality, anonymity, and privacy of the data. Remind participants that during the analysis of the information, no personal data of any participant will be added. If you do not obtain authorization to record the session, take notes on topics of conversation, interactions between participants, and other relevant data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversation diversion\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile deviations from the central theme can sometimes provide valuable insights, steer the conversation back to the research objectives when it strays too far. During the participants’ interventions, ask follow-up questions that allow you to close the ideas and/or redirect them to the research objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants trying to dominate the conversation\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally, some participants may attempt to dominate the discussion, overshadowing more reserved participants. Set ground rules at the start of the session regarding the length of contributions. Identify strategies for asking participants to close their ideas when they are too long. For example, you can use an eye-catching object like a signaling paddle to get participants to finish their contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants who are shy or reluctant to participate\n\n\n\n\n\nSome participants are too shy to participate or get pushed aside by those who seek to dominate the conversation. In these cases, you must control the situation so everyone can join the conversation. Use “icebreaker” activities at the beginning of the session in which everyone participates. Directly address less active attendees with open-ended questions that encourage them to express their thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolarization of the conversation\n\n\n\n\n\nSome topics may have one side polarization on the group discussion, leading to an “excessive consensus” where some participants may hesitate to contradict the dominant view on certain topics. This can limit the diversity of perspectives and affect data quality. Emphasize that all viewpoints are valuable and that there are no right or wrong answers. Divide the group into smaller subgroups to discuss certain topics, then reconvene to share different perspectives. Limit speaking time to prevent any one participant from monopolizing the discussion. If the conversation becomes hostile, remind the group of the activity’s purpose and, if necessary, pause the session.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequent mistakes during moderation\nWhen conducting focus groups, it is important to avoid common mistakes that can compromise the effectiveness of the session and the quality of the collected data. Some of the most critical mistakes are described here:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Common mistakes made when conducting focus groups",

To close the work session, it is recommended to (i) offer space for reflection in which participants can express comments, suggestions, or questions about what happened in the focus group; (ii) thank the participants for their time and willingness to participate, emphasizing that the opinions and information provided are of great importance for the study or research being conducted; and (iii) close the data flow, prioritizing the safe storage of the recording of the research activity. Some of the moderator’s responsibilities in this phase include:\n\nSupport data flow closure and secure storage of information.\nProvide the notes taken to the moderator.\nEnsure that all equipment used (tape recorders, computers, microphones, etc.) is complete.\n\nAt the end of the focus group, document the information obtained in detail. The lack of initial documentation products risks all information processing components and, thus, the quality of the obtained data. How this documentation is done is a decision linked to the research design and is determined before fieldwork begins. Record information as soon as the focus group concludes to prevent the loss of crucial details. This immediate action is vital to the research process. In addition, the products derived from the focus group must follow information storage protocols, which may include anonymization and encryption to avoid compromising the confidentiality of participants. Examples of products you can use for this purpose are:\n\nFull transcripts of the discussions\nDetailed notes taken during the research activity\nField notes\nField diaries",

    "text": "Data cleaning practices to help you manage data and ensure data integrity and reproducibility. Covers handling missing values, categorical and dummy variables, specify variables, skip logic, storage types, date variables, and logic tests for survey data.\nRaw survey data is often relatively clean at the variable-level because survey software generates the data with various constraints on how the data are formatted. For example, multiple response variables only allow certain responses which the analyst knows from the survey instrument. These responses do not change in content unless the survey does. For other types of variables, most computer-assisted personal interviewing software such as SurveyCTO allow for constraints to be built into the survey instrument. IPA has several open-sourced tools to support data quality during data collection such as the data management system, which checks for data quality concerns and ipaclean, which provides a set of tools for data cleaning and validation.\nMuch of the cleaning work required for survey data includes standardizing variable formats to make them usable for analysis. This includes ensuring missing and non-response values appear as missing in statistical software, that categorical formats are useful, and variables correspond to the correct storage format, subjective orientation, and follow missingness patterns. These are substantive coding tasks and can benefit from consistent and automated approaches. This section is primarily concerned with doing those tasks safely and quickly with minimal manual input or transcription.",

    "section": "Handling missing values",
    "text": "Handling missing values\nFor several reasons, variables will have missing values for certain observations. The data should reflect why these values are missing, particularly for numeric variables. For instance, you may want to know whether someone did not answer a question about business revenues because the question was skipped—they were not business owners—or because they could not remember.\n\nMissing values on import\nMany statistical software will import variables and observations that only contain missing values when importing from other data formats. Often, clearing those values immediately after importing data is useful. This can be done manually, or through the missing command which can be installed through SSC. One approach is to do this is as follows:\n*Import data starting on the row of variable names: B1\nimport excel using \"${raw}/rawdata.xlsx\", cellrange(B1) first clear allstring\n\n*Remove rows and columns with only missing\nmissing dropobs, force\nmissing dropvars, force // usually don't use force, but fine in this case\n\n*Ensure non-missing IDs\nisid id\nSometimes missing values appear as non-empty values in other data management software (SQL uses NULL, R uses two types: NA with four subtypes and NaN, etc.). Check data to ensure those values are removed or properly converted to missing after importing.\n*Check variable names if anything equals \"NULL\"\nds, has(type string) // only search strings\nforeach var in `r(varlist)' {\n    replace `var' = \"\" if `var' == \"NULL\"\n}\nFor numeric variables, this can be done in one line using recode. For example, imagine all -99 values should be missing values:\n*Recode -99 to missing for all values\nrecode * (-99=.)\n\n\nExtended missing values in Stata\nStata has special codes for numeric missing values. For numeric variables, missing values are considered to be greater in value than all other numbers and themselves have an order of magnitude. The magnitude of missing values increases across the alphabet, with the standard missing value . coming before .a: . &lt; .a &lt; .b &lt; .c &lt; … &lt; .z The .a, .b, etc. are called “extended missing values.” . Note that extended missing values cannot be stored in string variables. Instead, all string variables with a missing value are shown as \"\" (called “blank”).\nEnsure extended missing values consistently represent missing values in your data. For instance, if -99 and -999 refer to “don’t know” in two different waves of the survey, they should be standardized. In that case, you will want to replace all -99 and -999 values with .d. It can be helpful to use the recode command to efficiently replace those values. The following standards for extended missing values are recommended:\n\n\n\nType of Missing\nExtended Missing\n\n\n\n\nDon’t know\n.d\n\n\nOther\n.o\n\n\nNot applicable\n.n\n\n\nRefusal\n.r\n\n\nSkip\n.s\n\n\nVersion differences\n.v\n\n\n\nSome responses may require the enumerator to switch from the standard missing values (for example if a response is restricted to be positive, -99 may not be allowed). Other times, enumerators may enter the wrong missing value by mistake, such as -999 instead of -99. As part of the code to relabel missing values by type, you can include code that searches for these changes. The following code replaces multiple values and looks for positive versions of the missing values in outliers.\n*Assign numerical codes\nloc idk     -99 99 999  // numerical code for \"Don't Know\"\nloc rf      -77 77 75   // numerical code for \"Refuse\"\nloc na      -88         // numerical code for \"Not Applicable\"\nloc oth     -66         // numerical code for \"Other\"\nloc skip    -70         // numerical code for  \"Skip\"\n\n* Replace values for each type of refusal across numerical variables\nqui ds, not(type string)\nlocal numvars `r(varlist)'\nforeach var of local numvars {\n\n    ** Replace missing values as negative for unlabeled numeric variable above 0\n    if mi(\"`: value label `var''\") { // no labels from SurveyCTO import code\n\n        *Skip if value takes less than 0 values\n        if `var' &lt; 0 continue\n\n        *now check if value has missing\n        qui sum `var' if inlist(`var', 99, 88, 77, 66)\n        if `r(N)' == 0 continue // move to next variable if no values have positive version\n\n        * only change if this is the outlier value conditional on previous being completed\n        foreach val of 99 88 77 66 {\n            di \"`var' has `r(N)' cases of `val'\"\n            qui sum `var'\n            qui replace `var' = -`val' if `var' == `val' & (`r(max)' == `val' | `r(min)' == `val')\n        }\n        // end foreach val of 99 88 77 66\n\n    }\n    // end if mi(\"`: value label `var''\")\n\n    ** Relabel based on missing patterns\n    foreach x of local idk {\n        replace `var' = .d if `var' == `x'      // Don't know\n    }\n    // end foreach x of local idk\n    foreach x of local na {\n        replace `var' = .n if `var' == `x'      // N/A\n    }\n    // end foreach x of local na\n    foreach x of local oth {\n        replace `var' = .o if `var' == `x'      // Other\n    }\n    // end foreach x of local oth\n    foreach x of local rf {\n        replace `var' = .r if `var' == `x'      // Refuse\n    }\n    // end foreach x of local rf\n    foreach x of local skip {\n        replace `var' = .s if `var' == `x'      // Skip\n    }\n    // end foreach x of local\n}\n// end foreach var of local numvars\nCheck outliers and replacements manually, and search for modal responses in numeric variables that will not have missing values as outliers. Accurate responses can overlap with missing response codes. Automated replacement code, such as the code above, should only be completed after confirming that all inverted values are correct. Even better, use of defensive coding such as assert or the pause command will resolve this. The best solution is often to make sure that the data generating process guards against this type of messiness. Programming in confirmation questions in the survey (“Did the respondent really answer 99 or is this a missing value?”) can help accomplish this with more accuracy.",

    "text": "Categorical and dummy variables\nCategorical variables are ones that have no obvious ordering to the responses. For example, the question “What crop do you grow?” could have the following answers: soy bean, maize, cassava, ground nut, and yams. It can be helpful to have a numeric value attached to each response, however there is no clear ordering here. You can use the command encode to create a value for each in alphabetical order and it keeps the original response as the value label.\nDummy variables are one of the most common variable types you will use. These are also referred to as Boolean or indicator variables. These variables typically take on the values 0 and 1. However, it is important to note that your variable could and/or should have missing values if applicable. For example, an indicator about whether someone has a credit score could be defined as 1 for yes, 0 for no score and missing would mean there was no credit information available about that individual. Note that 0 and missing have different meanings and you should be careful around if and what values are missing. In Stata, you have several options for creating a dummy variable. Two examples of creating this “Has a credit score” dummy variable is below.\n\nThis first way recommended method is to start with an entirely missing variable and then replace with 1's and 0's for each condition.\n\ngen has_score = .\nreplace has_score = 1 if credit_score != .\nreplace has_score = 0 if (credit_score == . & info_available == 1)\nIt is important to note that 0 is defined for those missing a credit score but that credit information is available for, the observations that remain missing are those that are missing a credit score because there was no credit information available. You do not want to lose this information due to poor coding in which you say all these people have no score.\n\nThe second way is more concise but can be trickier.\n\ngen has_score = (credit_score != .) if (info_available == 1)\nThis method does the above in one step. The first half creates a 1/0 dummy by assigning 1 to any observation that meets the condition in the first parentheses and 0 if it does not. Then it uses the if and second parenthesis to assign missing values. If the second condition (info_available == 1) is false, then that observation will be missing. Either method is acceptable, just be careful to take the 0’s and missing values into account.",

    "section": "“Specify” Variables",
    "text": "“Specify” Variables\nSurvey questions may have a “specify” option, in which the respondent explains their answer or gives an alternate answer not available on the list of choices for that question. These are often triggered by an “other” response. In the raw dataset, alongside the original variable will be a “specify” variable that shows the comments for that question. You (or someone else familiar with the survey) will sometimes need to read through these specify answers and then recode the original variable accordingly. (“Specify” variables are also called other/specify variables, “other” variables, and free-text variables.)\nFor example, if a question asked for someone’s favorite color, giving the options of blue, red, yellow, green, and other. If someone answered “other” and then wrote “sky blue” for their answer, you would want to recode the original variable for favorite color to say “blue” instead of “other.” However, if someone wrote “purple” you could leave their response as is (or, if enough people wrote purple, you could add another category to the variable).\nParticularly for large surveys, this can be a hassle. One helpful approach is to do the following:\n\nFirst clean each string variable so that similar answers will show the same value. Use string functions like lower(), trim(), and itrim() to convert answers like “PUR pLE”, ” Purple” and “purple” to all be “purple”.\nFor each specify variable, collapse the dataset into unique answers (for example, if three people wrote “purple” the collapsed dataset would only show “purple” once).\nStore those unique answers into a spreadsheet with another column that shows what variable the answer corresponds to. Then, leave one column blank, which you will eventually fill in with the value from the original variable that the response corresponds to (if it should be recoded). For instance, next to “purple” you would put nothing, but next to “sky blue” you would put 1 if 1 corresponded to the “blue” answer option.\nWrite code to merge the manual corrections from the excel file back into the do file, instead of running this as a series of replace or if `var' == \"sky blue\" | `var' == \"ocean blue\" | `var' == ... commands in the do file.\n\nMake sure you save do files and documents so that this process can be replicated and understood by someone else in the future.\nThis data flow would like the following. First, the specify responses are cleaned and saved so that the excel sheet can be modified.\n/* MR 10/25/2019:\n  The variable q_oth is the \"specify\" variable corresponding to\n  the variable q If q == 99, then q_oth has a string value input\n  by the enumerator.\n\n  First, I standardize strung responses of the q_other variable and\n  then output an excel document with each unique response.\n*/\n*String cleaning\ngen q_oth_cl = q_oth // create a clean copy to preserve the raw data\nreplace q_oth_cl = lower(q_oth_cl)\nreplace q_oth_cl = strtrim(q_oth_cl) // only trim external spaces so \"sky blue\" does not become \"skyblue\"\n\n*Save excel file\ntempvar map // create column header\ngen `map' = \"\"\nlab var `map'  \"Mapping\"\nlab var q_oth_cl \"Other values\"\n\n*Save to temporary file folder in the in the project folder\npreserve\n\n  keep q_oth_cl `map'\n  duplicates drop q_oth_cl, force\n  export excel q_oth_cl `map' using \"${temp}q_oth.xlsx\", firstrow(varl) replace\n\nrestore\nThis results in a table that looks like this:\n\n\n\nOther\nMapping\n\n\n\n\nsky blue\n1\n\n\nocean blue\n1\n\n\nnavy\n1\n\n\ndepends on the day\n-66\n\n\npurple\n\n\n\n\nThe RA would fill out the mapping column based on the allowed values in the survey. This means that the “Mapping” column would take 1 for the “sky blue” value if the data uses 1 for the survey. If the data uses string values at this point in the cleaning process the “Mapping” column could be filled with “blue.” Ensure that this process is reproducible and rule based. Inconsistent mapping of variables does not create clean data. After this table is completed, it can be merged back into the file to save the values.\nThe code to complete that looks like this:\n/* MR 10/25/19:\n  For question \"q\", specified other values were cleaned according to the\n  following rules:\n    -Any color response with more than 1% of the sample was\n     added as a category\n    -Specified colors that are a subset of the option (sample)\n    -Non-colors were replaced as missing\n      -Extended missing values were used if these should have been\n      an extended missing value captured by the survey.\n\n  These values were saved in a file in the Project Folder at:\n    ../08_Analysis&Results/01_Cleaning/05_Temp/q_oth_mapped.xlsx\n  They will then be merged in and replaced to the individual variables.\n*/\n*Load in data and save a tempfile\npreserve\n\n  import excel using \"${temp}q_oth_mapped.xlsx\", first clear\n  keep if !mi(Mapping) // only merge on mapped values\n  ren Othervalues q_oth_cl // change the file back to q_oth for the merge\n  tempfile q_oth_mapping\n  save `q_oth_mapping'\n\nrestore\n\n*Merge on file\nmmerge q_oth_cl using `q_oth_mapping', t(n:1) missing(nomatch)\n/*\n  Alternatively, merge to the subset of responses with non_missing values and\n  append these files afterwards using \"merge m:1 q_oth using `q_oth_mapping'\"\n*/\nassert _merge == -1 | _merge == 1 | _merge == 3 // missing, no coding, or coded\n\n*Replace values\nlevelsof q // first collect every level of q and replace\nloc levels `r(levels)'\nforeach level of local levels {\n  replace q = `level' if mapping == `level'\n}\n\n*Replace extended values\n// do this manually\n\n*replace missing values to IPA standard missing values\nreplace q = .d if mapping == -66 // don't know\nreplace q = .r if mapping == -77 // refusal\nreplace q = .n if mapping == -88 // not applicable\n\n*finally check that everything was captured\nassert q != 99 if _merge == 3 // this assumes 99 == other in the survey AND that the all values were coded\ndrop _merge q_oth_cl mapping // remove extraneous variable",

    "section": "Skip Logic",
    "text": "Skip Logic\nSurveys will likely have skip logic. For instance, if a respondent says they have zero goats to a question, the survey may instruct the surveyor to (or the program may automatically) go to questions about sheep instead of questions about the quality of goat cheese the respondent makes from their goats. When a survey is bench tested and piloted, you should have tested that these skips worked by developing a series of checks based on a close reading of the survey instrument itself. However, skips may not be passed to the final dataset by some programs, such as SurveyCTO. This can make it hard to check if there were any errors in the survey coding.\nDefining additional missing values for skips and for questions that were not asked, such as those in long repeat groups can be helpful for two reasons:\n\nSkip values that take an extended missing values can be identified using ==.s without capturing other types of general missing values .s.\nExcluding skip values from the general missing value . can help to identify errors in cleaning later on, as Stata will not impute .s normally. Then, failures in skip logic can be identified as part of the cleaning process. If some of the skips did not work or allowed for some entry error among respondents, document the issues by outputting a list of the problematic observations into a spreadsheet and mention it to the PIs.\n\nThe following code assigns skip values and then confirms that the skips were successful during the survey implementation. It can be very helpful to use the assert command to check this. In addition, ensure that the observations who answered those questions are marked in the data by a dummy variable named in a consistent manner.\n/*\n    In this example, there is a module that asks about business profits\n    only if the respondent has a business. The question that starts\n    a set of questions, b_prof_s*, on business profits is b_prof_yn.\n    All questions should be skipped if  b_prof_yn == 0, but the\n    variables b_prof_s* exist if any respondent has a business.\n\n    First we assign the skip missing value to all observations if they\n    do not have a value.

    "text": "Storage Types in Stata\nStatistical software requires a storage type to determine how and what data to store about each variable or value. This storage type determines if the software treats a variable as text or a number, and how much information is stored in each variable. This information could be how many digits of precision are required or if the variable is just 0 or 1s. Some data types such as dates have specific metadata attached – January 1, 1960 was a Friday – that relate to storage type.\nVariables are stored in two broad categories: string (text) or numeric. For tasks in analysis such as regression, Stata requires categorical variables to be stored as numeric variables, not string variables. This is also beneficial for storage size of variables. As a rule of thumb in Stata, ordinal and categorical variable should be stored as numeric variables with labeled values. Only text or IDs should ever be stored as a string variables. Labeling categorical variables is preferred and should be treated as a part of data management.\nStorage formats such string or numeric are the variable’s type, different from its format. Variable formats affect how Stata displays values of variables to the user and are loosely related to the storage type – a string cannot be displayed with significant digits for example.\nNumeric variables are stored as byte, int, long, float or double. Float and double are the two that can hold non-integer numbers (decimals) and are the most common. More details on how numerical formats may affect datasets is available in this guide article. Numerical and string formats can be changed using the recast command, or by specifying a storage format using the generate command.\nString variables storage types are identified by their character length (str4 has 4 characters, str7 has 7 characters, etc.,). Variables are stored as string if they have any nonnumeric character in them (this includes commas and periods if they are imported as such). See help data_types for more information about variable types. Useful commands to go between string and numeric variables are destring and tostring. The command destring turns a variable from a string into a numeric (must contain all nonnumeric characters). The command tostring changes a numeric variable into a string variable. To convert strings to labeled numeric formats and vice versa see the encode and decode (or sencode and sdecode user-written commands).\nA variable’s format controls how the data is displayed. This is can be used to format numeric variables to display with commas or a specific number of decimal points. For details on the corresponding formats for each variable type and how to format variables, type help format. In short, it’s important to match the displayed format to the content, especially for outputs, so that content can be interpretable by humans.",

    "text": "Date variables\nDates are especially complex to work with in Stata. Stata stores dates as a numeric variable that captures either the number of days, months, quarters, or years since January 1, 1960. It is important to know that dates can also have a time component (datetimes), and are then stored as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1960. These formats are numeric, but once they are stored as a date in Stata several special Stata functions can be applied to them to help with calculations that relate to dates and time. For more information see h datetime translation.\nSurvey CTO defaults to storing date variables as strings when importing them to Stata. It’s advantageous to convert these variables to a proper date format, as it allows for various logical and mathematical calculations. For example, you could count the number of days between a survey start date and submission date, or the number of minutes between the survey was started and completed. The SurveyCTO datetime metadata (starttime endtime submissiondate) are already stored as date variables.starttime and endtime are formatted as datetimes (%tc) and submissiondate is formatted as a date (%td)).\nTo convert imported dates to be stored as a date type in Stata, the functions date() and mdy() will convert non-date variables to date-formatted variables. The functions clock() and mdyhms() will convert non-date variables to datetime-formatted variables. The date() and clock() functions are useful if your dates are stored as a string variable whereas the mdy() and mdyhms() functions are useful if your dates are stored as numeric variables. These commands will create a variable that is the number of days, or the number of milliseconds, since January 1, 1960.\nFor a set of SurveyCTO datetimes using the same format, the following code will convert all of the variables to Stata date formats and check for data quality:\n*Define list of date variable\nds *_date // this should match your naming convention\nloc date_vars `r(varlist)'\n\n*save tempvar so indifferent to var length\ntempvar temp\n* create double to store datetime to avoid rounding\ngen double `temp' = .\n\n*Foreach date variable, convert to datetime and run checks\nforeach var of local date_vars {\n\n    *Display progress\n    di \"Working on `var'\"\n\n    *Skip if the date is already formatted as any date\n    /*\n        Note: This could also standardize formats using\n        the following code:\n\n        if regexm(\"`: format `v''\", \"%tc\") {\n             replace `v' = cofd(`v')\n             format `v' %tc_CCYY_NN_DD\n        }\n        else if regexm(\"`: format `var'', \"%t\") continue\n    */\n    if regexm(\"`: format `var''\", \"%t\") continue\n\n    *Convert from string to date\n    /*\n        Note: This specifies a format that all variables share.\n        See h datetime in Stata for an overview on how to define\n        datetime formats for the clock() and date() functions.\n    */\n    loc varl : var label `var' // save var label\n    replace `temp' = . // clear tempvar\n    replace `temp' = clock(`var', \"MDYhms\")\n    *drop the variable as cannot replace values and convert type\n    drop `var'\n    gen double `var' = `temp'\n    format `var' %tcCCYY_NN_DD__HH:MM:SS // choose a preferred format\n\n    *Check within range\n    loc survey_start = clock(\"Jan. 01 1960, 12:00:00 AM\", \"MDYhms\")\n    loc survey_end = clock(\"Feb. 29 2020, 11:59:59 PM\", \"MDYhms\")\n    assert inrange(`var', `survey_start', `survey_end')\n\n    *Check non-missing for calculate fields\n    /*\n        This may not be the case for all projects if some\n        calculate fields are conditional on being read\n    */\n    assert !mi(`var')\n\n}\n// end foreach var of local date_vars\nSome of these checks will duplicate checks conducted as part of IPA’s data management system. It doesn’t hurt to run these confirmations, but we recommend using the data management system to be aware of any problems as soon as possible.\nIf you would like to convert your daily variable into a monthly or yearly variable you can use the following functions: mofd() and yofd(). You can find descriptions of all the functions that convert between which count types for dates (daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly) by typing help date() and clicking on “Date and time functions” to go to the Stata manual.\nOnce you have date in the right type, you can work with the formatting of the variable. The formatting is how you make the date look like a date rather than the underlying numeric value. You can read how to format your dates in any way imaginable by typing help datetime display formats. Note that changing the format of a date variable does not change its underlying value.",

    "section": "Logic tests",
    "text": "Logic tests\nClean data should be free of mistakes such as out of range values. Yet, the thousands of lines of survey, database management, cleaning and analysis code that make up projects often contain a number of mistakes. These mistakes are a natural part of any large project. Instead of focusing on having mistake-free code in all cases, it’s often more effective to write code that tests for if the data matches expectations. This approach does not substitute for code review and being careful, but\nCommands like assert in Stata and stopifnot() in R allow the programmer to break the code if some logic test is not met. Logic tests check if the values observed in the data make sense given other values. For instance, can someone who says they were born in 2000 really have been a member of their current community for thirty years? These tests are used to ensure that the clean data is truly clean, not just that the programmer thinks the data are clean.\nThe list of logic tests to test is dependent on each individual dataset. Check for things that would be problematic for data analysis, such as missing values in variables you expect to always have a value. These checks should include other problems in the data that would clearly indicate that something is wrong with the data such as responses to a Likert scale survey question that wasn’t in the list of programmed responses. If any of those tests fail, flag the values in the data and bring them up with the PIs.\n\nDefensive Programming\nIn computer science, programming that ensures a program can function under unanticipated situations conditions is called defensive programming. It can be useful to bring this mentality into social science research. In many cases, defensive programming is natural with the type of data we work with. Many variables have characteristics that we expect from the data and can be easily checked. For example, for a survey of employed adults in the US, with a working age of 18, no respondents should have age below 18.\nWe can check that this is the case in Stata:\nassert age &gt;= 18 & !mi(age) // . is considered infinitely large by Stata, so &gt; 18 captures missing values as well.\nBuilding these tests into your data flow should be a natural test that you work into data cleaning. This can be expanded to other functions like merges. If every household but one received both an agricultural and household survey, each household survey should merge to the plot dataset except one observation. The merge can be checked to confirm that that is the case:\n*Check merge success rate\nmerge 1:1 id using \"plots.dta\" // note: merge has a built-in assert option\ncount if _merge != 3 // check how many merges did not have an observation in both\nassert `r(N)' == 1\nThese tests should be built into cleaning code, as they are computationally cheap unless data is large. They should be executed every time the code runs, and should test major modifications that affect important variables.\n\n\nLogic Tests for Survey Data\nSurvey data has the benefit of coming from a survey that you, as an analyst, have probably programmed. The survey software and import process often controls for many types of errors. However, data management errors can also occur due to the particular forms that survey data contains. These errors are common in survey data management:\n\nMissing values occur in variables that the programmer assumes always has real values\n\nMissing values are inconsistently defined in the survey and are not fully replaced (e.g. “Not Applicable” is -99, -98, and 77)\n\nVariable or value options change between survey versions and aren’t reconciled\n\nVariables with the same name are overwritten as part of a merge. See h mmerge for a user written command that stores this information.\n\nObservations are not unique and some actions such as sorting become irreproducible\n\nTesting for these errors as part of the cleaning process is strongly recommended.\n\n\nLogic Tests in Administrative Data\nThere are often broader concerns for administrative data since analysts do not directly control the data generation and management process. This means that data definitions and formats may change or be inconsistent over longitudinal data.\nSome additional concerns to focus on in administrative data are:\n\nEnsure that variables remain consistent over repeated deliveries\nData translation and missingness standards of the storage system may create values in statistical software (e.g. SQL treats missing as “NULL”)\n\nVariable consistency can be handled using value labeling in Stata. For example, to ensure that data remains the same over the course of data collection, it can be useful to check that categorical variables map to expected values to a previously created value label. The noextend option of the encode commands allows you to confirm no values exist in the variable other than those in the supplied label. The following code accomplishes this:\n*Create a local list of variables to encode\nloc str_var var\n\n*Encode values and confirm expected\nforeach var of local str_var {\n\n    *Encode variables\n    sencode `var', label(`var'_label) replace noextend // type h sencode to see options\n}\n// end foreach v of local str_var",

This transition occurs when data moves from generation—in surveys or automated banking systems—to analysis-ready formats. The contents of the data do not change during this process, but the storage, aggregation, and labeling formats do change.\nThis entire process constitutes a data flow. At GPRL and IPA, the data flow includes four key steps that take place in statistical software. Differences in the data may make it impossible to follow this order exactly. Deidentification should happen as soon as possible in the data flow if the data contains PII:\n\n\n\nData Flow Process\n\n\n\n\nImport data: Combine all collected data into a format readable by statistical software. This step imports raw data, applies corrections from enumerators, and removes duplicate observations.\nDeidentify data: Remove personally identifying information—PII. This includes all individually identifying PII—geographic information, names, addresses, enumerator comments, etc.—as well as group identifying information such as a combination of village and birthdate.\nClean data: Standardize data content, formats, and encoding. After this, verify data consistency and append similar datasets to create single datasets for outcome creation.\nCreate outcomes: Create individual outcome variables from the clean data.

Researchers must create outcome variables from standardized sets of variables. Additionally, analysts must add documentation so data users understand what each dataset contains.\nRaw data often needs corrections and deduplication that requires additional data from enumerators or respondents. Data collection for replacement forms part of the data collection process. Researchers often collect and make these replacements during monitoring. IPA and GPRL have produced many tools and resources to help this process. In particular, IPA’s Data Management System supports data quality monitoring, duplicate management, and corrections.\nAfter data reaches an importable format, the raw data will have its own idiosyncrasies. The cleaning process attempts to standardize these idiosyncrasies in a reproducible way. Consider three surveys, each with slightly different outputs. Cleaning makes the output from those datasets equivalent in format. The process applies standardized modifications to the content. The code that produces those data should run any number of times and should tell the user if something about the data has changed so that it cannot accomplish its function.\nThe cleaning process includes four rough stages:\n\nRaw Survey Data Management\nVariable Management\nDataset, Value, and Variable Documentation\nData Aggregation\n\nEach stage has a description in the guide, as well as a list of tasks with dedicated subpages.

Many users expect this merge type to create all pair-wise combinations of matching observations, but it actually pairs datasets based on observation order within each ID. Use joinby if you need all pair-wise combinations.\n\n\nPost-Merge Validation\nAfter merging, validate results by checking the _merge variable. Each match type receives a numeric code. Use tab _merge to verify that results match expectations: number of matches, master-only observations, using-only observations, updated missing values, and conflicting nonmissing values.\nConsider adding assertions after merging to ensure correct execution.

For machine-entered data, removing common mismatch sources like spaces and inconsistent capitalization may help. Manual matching works for small datasets, but large datasets often require fuzzy matching solutions.\nFuzzy matching finds approximately similar strings rather than exact matches. These algorithms provide match probabilities and only apply when exact matching is impossible. Consult with your manager before using fuzzy matching, as its match rate is typically lower than exact matching. Exact matching remains preferable when possible.\n\nFuzzy Matching Process\nFuzzy matching typically involves three steps:\n\nString cleaning: standardize spaces, capitalization, and remove special characters. This may include removing common phrases like titles in names.\nProbabilistic matching: algorithms estimate match probabilities between observations in different datasets.\nMatch review: review matches to determine the success threshold, then manually verify remaining matches.\n\n\n\nStata Commands for Fuzzy Matching\nSeveral user-written commands support fuzzy matching in Stata.

Match multiple columns sequentially and average or weight probabilities for multi-column matching.\nFeatures multiple matching algorithms explained in the help file. All algorithms provide multiple likely matches for second-best guesses. Merge results using joinby or merge, but matchit does not function as a merge command.\n\n\nstrgroup\nInstall with net install strgroup.

Data preparation typically involves joining a master variable to ID variables in the using dataset.\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\nNumerous other commands and approaches exist for this problem.

    "section": "Variable names",
    "text": "Variable names\nVariable names often come from the prior method of data storage. These names may not work well for coding in statistical software due to length, formatting, or clarity. Standardizing these names to usable and interpretable formats is one of the first steps to ensure datasets are easy and intuitive to use.\nIf you use SurveyCTO data, the SurveyCTO import template automatically generates variable names and labels for you upon import. If you use other data or skip this template, you will need to rename your variables.\n\nNaming Standards\nVariable names should balance interpretability by users with the utilities that statistical software provides. For example, in Stata, several commands allow using wildcard commands such as * and ? to stand in for patterns in the data. This allows you to modify data systematically. If all income variables start with the inc_ prefix, you can modify every variable at once:\n*Call all income variables\nds inc_*\nBalance the following considerations while naming variables:\n\nGroup variable names that describe outcome categories. For example, prefix all variables that count yield with y_.\nGroup types of variables like comment fields with a unique substring such as _note.\nCreate names that have substantive meaning and are easy to type. For example, use inc_bus_ and inc_ag instead of section1b_ and section2a_.\nFor indicator variables, name the variable what the value “1” indicates rather than the category. For example, if a variable takes 1 when a respondent is female and 0 when male, name the variable female not gender.\nCreate unique and consistent naming patterns across all datasets used in the project:\n\nTwo datasets with different units of analysis should not use the uninformative variable name id\nTwo datasets that describe income at various levels should use the same prefix to describe the same construct. For example, plot-level income could be inc_ag_plot1 and baseline household income could be inc_ag*_bl.\n\n\nIn wide data, it’s also important to consider how statistical software performs. Often times patterning variable names is necessary for tasks like reshaping to work smoothly. In wide-data stored in Stata, reshape uses a stub in the variable name to identify the value the long dataset would take for each group. Ensuring that variables are named consistently (e.g. baseline variables are suffixed by _1, midline by _2, and endline by _3) can make it easier to reshape datasets.\n\n\nRenaming in Stata\nStata’s rename command is used to change variable names. While it is possible to rename multiple variables with these commands, it can often be easier to rename many variables from an external file such as an .xls. However, rename allows for some operators to rename multiple variables that share patterns. These commands can be very powerful and can sometimes capture variables that you do not intend to rename. See h rename group for a full description of renaming commands. Some options that are relevant for survey data follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended command\nFunction\nExample\n\n\n\n\n*\nAny number of characters\nren year_* * removes the prefix year_ from all variable names that start with year_\n\n\n?\nExactly one character\nren monday_? day_?_1 would change monday_a to day_a_1\n\n\n#\nOne or more digit (numeric only)\nren age# age(##) renames all numeric variables to use a minimum of two digits for number suffixes (e.g. age_1 becomes age_01)\n\n\n, renumber\nReorders names to increase by 1\nren survey_# survey_#, renumber reorders all variables prefixed with survey_ that end with a number so that they increase by 1\n\n\n\nAlso see renvars (net search renvars to install) a user written command that can help with complicated renaming tasks.\n\n\nRenaming from External Files\nIf you are renaming/labeling a lot of variables it can be cleaner to put them in an excel file and import from there, rather than writing it all in your do file.

    "text": "Variable labels\nStata variables have both names and labels. Variable names are what Stata uses to define a column. Variable labels provide additional information that you can display to the analyst. Names should follow patterns that make programming easy. For example, you could code all consumption questions as cons_1 - cons_20 and call them with ds cons_? cons_??. Use variable labels as descriptors that say exactly what the variable is about. You can pull the exact question text from the survey, or use a paraphrased version if the text is lengthy.\n\nSystematizing labels\nVariable labels provide information about variable names that you often define for programmatic reasons.\n\nGive all variables labels, and give all multiple choice variables value labels.\nKeep the labeling system internally consistent.\nMake it easy to connect the variable in the dataset with the question on the questionnaire. Most analysis happens with the questionnaire in hand.\n\nOne format for defining variable labels for survey data includes both the question number in the questionnaire and a description of the contents in the variable. The basic format for that system is:\nVariable name: descriptive name that uses prefixes or suffixes to provide patterns\nVariable label: [question_number] descriptive label\nThis style is implemented below:\n*Define variable labels variables\nlabel var child_15      \"[QA.101] Has children under 15\"\nlabel var child_15B     \"[QA.102a] Number boys under 15\"\nlabel var child_15B_S       \"[QA.102b] Number boys in school\"\nlabel var child_15G     \"[QA.103a] Number girls under 15\"\nlabel var child_15G_S       \"[QA.103b] Number girls in school\"\nNote that this code aligns the variable names and the variable labels in the text. This makes it easy to read the labeling as a programmer.\n\n\nLabels from SurveyCTO\nSurveyCTO automatically labels variables using questions from the survey instrument. However, Stata allows labels a maximum of only 80 characters, which means SurveyCTO imports often truncate the labels. For tips on how to attach information longer than 80 characters see the variable notes guide.\n\n\nStata Storage of Variable Labels\nStata can use value label data using the extended macro functions (see h extended_fcn). The following code calls a variable label and assigns it to a local.\n*Call variable label of variable \"var\"\nlocal vlab : variable label var\nThis information can be searched conditionally. If, for example, you wanted to only apply a function to variables in the “QA” section of the survey defined in “Systematizing Labels” section in this article, you could check to see if the label starts with “[QA.”:\n\nforeach var of varlist _all {\n    if regexm(\"`: variable label var'\", \"^\\[QA\") {\n        [do something]\n    }\n    // end if regexm(\"`: variable label var'\", \"^\\[QA\\.\") {\n}\n// end foreach var in `r(varlist)",

    "section": "Variable metadata",
    "text": "Variable metadata\nSometimes you want to attach information or other labeling that is longer than Stata allows (labels are capped at 80 characters). If this is the case, you can store the full desired label into the variable notes or characteristics. Both notes and characteristics can describe variables or the dta file.\n\nNotes\nOne variable can have multiple notes. Add notes into variables by typing note VARIABLE : \"Note\". For example, for variable VARIABLE the note note was added. To display the notes stored in one variable just type “notes VARIABLE”. Stata also stores notes as locals and you can call them using `VARIABLE[note1]'. Stata numbers these notes based on the order in which it receives them. You can modify and delete note ordering with the note command (see help notes in Stata).\nSurvey CTO includes the full text of the question from the survey instrument as variable notes (as well as the truncated questions as variable labels) as part of the import do file. These notes will always be in the downloaded language. They will not contain filled values for the respondent that are produced as the result of calculate fields.\nIf you have changed or converted variable labels as part of a data transformation, you can convert notes into labels by looping through variables and using the stored local for notes:\n*Loop through each variable in the varlist VARIABLES\nforeach var of varlist VARIABLES {\n    label var `var' ``var'[note1]'\n}\n\n\nThe char command\nAdditional information can be added using characteristics, which function similarly to notes. The Stata manual describes characteristics as “an arcane feature of Stata [that] are great use to Stata programmers.” Many commands use and define specific named characteristics to attach metadata. Characteristics (type help char in Stata) can describe variables and the dataset itself.\nThe main difference between characteristics and notes is that the char command requires a name for each characteristic. Whereas note VARIABLE : \"Note\" creates the next sequential note (1 if the first note, 2 if the second, etc.), char explicitly requires a character name, “charname” in the following code: char define VARIABLE[charname] \"Note\". This can be useful for saving labels in multiple languages. These characteristics can then be called by name, instead of an arbitrarily assigned number.\nFor example, a data flow could take labels in each language from a SurveyCTO form and assign them as characteristics to each variable produced by the survey in the following:\n*Import SurveyCTO\nimport excel using \"Baseline Household Survey.xlsx\", first clear\n\n*Keep variables with labels\nkeep type name label labelbangla relevance\nren label labelenglish\nren label* * // rename to remove \"label_\" prefix from all variables\n\n*Remove variables not exported to Stata\ndrop if inlist(type, \"begin group\",  ///\n  \"end group\", \"image\", \"begin repeat\", \"end repeat\")\ndrop type\n\n*Only keep variables with non_missing\nds name, not // get list of label variables\nloc languages `r(varlist)' relevance\negen has_lab = rownonmiss(`languages'), strok\n// keep only rows with has_lab\nkeep if has_lab &gt;= 1 & !mi(has_lab)\n\n*Save variables and language names\nloc varnames // init empty\nforval i = 1(1)`=_N' {\n  loc name = name[`i'] // save name of variable\n\n  *Save labels as locals\n  loc j = 1 // init counter at start\n  foreach language of local languages {\n     loc `name'_`j' = `language'[`i']\n     loc ++j\n  }\n  // end foreach language of local languages\n\n  *save local of names to add question text to\n  loc varnames `varnames' `name'\n}\n// end forval i = 1(1)_N\n\n*Load data\nuse survey.dta, clear\n\n*Loop through names to add characteristics\nforeach name of local varnames {\n  ds `name'* // collect names that are inclusive of repeat groups\n  loc varl `r(varlist)'\n\n  foreach var of local varl {\n\n  *Confirm only the variable or the repeat group\n  cap assert \"`var'\" == \"`name'\" | regexm(\"`var'\",\"^`name'[0-9][0-9]?$\")\n  if _rc continue // skip if \"`name'\" is a prefix\n\n     *add characteristic as a named language\n     loc j = 1\n     foreach language of local languages {\n        char define `var'[`language'] \"``name'_`j''\"\n        loc ++j\n     }\n     // end foreach language of local languages\n\n  }\n  // end foreach var of local varl\n\n}\n// end foreach name of local names",

    "section": "Value labels",
    "text": "Value labels\nFor categorical variables the raw data often shows the string values for the selected response. For instance, you may see “male” and “female” as possible responses to the variable gender. When doing calculations, however, you need these variables to be numeric (in the float or long format) if they are not already imported this way. Preserve the extra information the strings capture by using “value labels.” A value label such as gender would assign “female” to 0 and “male” to 1 and display female and male to the analyst. See help label for how to do this in Stata. Label values for two important reasons:\n\nit provides information to the analyst that reduces mistakes in coding or analyzing data\nmany programs use information on whether a variable has value labels to identify it as a categorical variable, as opposed to a continuous numeric variable.\n\n\nEncoding String Values in Stata\nThe quickest way to change string variables to numeric variables with value labels is the encode command. encode automatically converts the string variable into a numeric variable and assigns the numbers 1-x (where x is the number of unique answer choices) to the alphabetized list of the answer choices (ordered 0-9, followed by a-z). Because this happens automatically based on alphabetical order, you may need to recode or label them manually if you want value labels to match some existing assignment.\nStata stores value labels independently from the variables, so manage value labels separately from variables as they can contain PII. Deleting all variables that have a value label and saving the dataset removes the value label from the .dta file. To see which labels Stata currently defines and their content, use the label list command. The return values of label list and label dir also store helpful summary information. You can modify or delete these labels to combine using the options of label define function:\n*Drop old labels\nlabel drop ex1 ex2 ex3\n\n*Define label\nlabel define yesno 1 \"No\" 3 \"Yes\"\nlabel list yesno\n\n*Modify label to correct the error\nlabel define yesno 1 \"No\" 2 \"Yes\", modify\n\n*Add extended values to the label defined above\nlabel define yesno .n \"No response\" 3 \"Maybe\", add\n\n*Apply the label to all of the variables it should apply to\nloc dummy_vars ex1 ex2 ex3\nlabel values `dummy_vars' yesno\n\n\nFormatting Labeling in Stata\nIt can be useful to change the delimiter to a semicolon so that a single command can take up several rows in your text editor, making it easier to read labeling. This is especially useful when multiple values are labeled. See help delimit to learn about delimiters in Stata. An example would be:\n* Set delimiter for labeling\n#delimit ;\n\nlabel def female\n    0 \"[0] Male\"\n    1 \"[1] Female\"\n;\n\nlabel def region\n    1 \"[1] Northern\"\n    2 \"[2] Southern\"\n    3 \"[3] Western\"\n    4 \"[4] Eastern\"\n    5 \"[5] Central\"\n;\n\n#delimit cr\n\nlabel values female female\nlabel values region region\nNote how the labels have the corresponding value as well as the description in the value label. This is not strictly necessary, but can be useful if you want values to display alongside labels in outputs.\n\n\nDefensive Workflow for Encoding Values\nOne way to ensure that data is encoded in an expected way is to check that values are only encoded from a pre-specified list of value labels that you defined. The user written command sencode (install using ssc install sencode) can help support this. sencode labels the variable according to the values that you’ve predefined and then adds additional values in order from the highest value if it encounters values that you haven’t defined. An example data flow follows:\n*Ensure sencode is installed\ncap which sencode\nif _rc ssc install sencode\n\n*Load data\n    sysuse auto, clear\nkeep if _n &lt;= 10 // Keep the first ten observations of the sample\n\n# del ;\n\n/*\nThis label is named by the variable name, an \"_\", and then \"label\"\nso that we can loop over the labels.\n*/\nlabel define make_label\n    1   \"AMC Concord\"\n    2   \"AMC Pacer\"\n    3   \"AMC Spirit\"\n    4   \"Buick Century\"\n    5   \"Buick Electra\"\n    6   \"Buick LeSabre\"\n    7   \"Buick Opel\"\n    8   \"Buick Regal\"\n    9   \"Buick Riviera\"\n    10  \"Buick Skylark\"\n;\n\n# del cr\n\n*Create a local list of variables to encode\nloc str_var make\n\n*Encode values and confirm expected\nforeach var of local str_var {\n\n    *Encode variables\n    /*\n    type h sencode to see options, the noextend option returns an error\n    if the existing label doesn't capture all values.\n    */\n    sencode `var', label(`var'_label) replace noextend\n}\n// end foreach v of local str_var\n\n*Display the labeled and unlabeled values\ntab make\ntab make, nol",

These formats usually result from the form best used to capture the data and not to process it.

Finally, since survey data often holds many sources of personally identifying information in the raw format, deidentification is often important and requires specific focus. Changes in survey version content may exacerbate this process and require multiple imports. This section provides information on these tasks.

    "section": "Importing into Stata",
    "text": "Importing into Stata\nData comes in many forms, from raw text (.txt) files to multi-sheet Excel (.xls and .xlsx) files. Importing data into Stata is necessary if the data is not already in Stata format (.dta file). In general, you should be able to use Stata’s functions and loops to efficiently import data. Stata can import most data formats. If your project’s data was collected using a platform like SurveyCTO, the raw data will come in .csv format and the SurveyCTO server will provide a do file that imports the raw .csv data into the Stata .dta format.\n\nImporting different file types\nIn Stata 13 and beyond, the import command can import CSV files, excel files, and more depending on the option used (delimited for CSV, excel for excel), and export does the same for exporting. The import excel and import delimited commands provide a number of options that allow for a large amount of control of importing including from where in the workbook data should be imported from and how data should be saved. See help import for details on these options.\nIf you are new to using import are importing a file type you have not seen before, it can be helpful to use the drop-down menu by clicking “File&gt;Import” and then selecting the appropriate file type. Once you do this, you will be able to copy the specific command syntax directly from the command prompt or review window in Stata to your do-file.\nThe insheet command remains an alternative for .csv, .tsv, and .txt files. It performs differently than import delimited and can be useful for some forms of data, but import delimited should be used preferentially. One thing to note is that it is often a good idea when using the insheet command, to use the option names and have your dataset have the same variable names at those at the top of the raw dataset.\n\n\nImporting multiple files at once\nA useful function for importing multiple files within a folder is the dir extended macro function. You can find documentation on this by typing help extended_fcn in Stata. This function allows you to store all the names of the files in a folder in a local so you can loop through them for importing. See example code of this process below.\n/* This stores all files with the extension .xlsx in the\n\"$raw\" data folder into a local \"files\" */\nlocal files: dir \"$raw\" files \"*.xlsx\", respectcase\n\n/* Loop through the files to import, clean the file name,\nand save as a dta */\nforeach file in `files' {\n\n    *Show your progress of which file you are working on\n    di in red \"working on `file'\"\n\n    *Import each file\n    import excel using \"$raw/`file'\", clear firstrow\n\n    **Quality Checks (Optional)\n    *Assert you have the correct number of observations.\n    qui count\n    // If you know the amount of expected observations\n    assert `r(N)' == [number_of_expected_observations]\n\n    /*Check that what variables you think should be unique\n    identifiers are indeed unique. */\n    isid unique_id_var\n\n    *Check for expected/necessary variables\n    confirm var expected_var_names\n\n    * Edit filename\n    /*The filenames in the local \"files\" includes the\n    extension (in this case .xlsx). So, I remove these and\n    make new clean file name to save the files as.\n    You can edit the filenames however you see fit. */\n    local cleanfilename = subinstr(\"`file'\", \".xlsx\",\"\",.)\n\n    *Save the file with the new clean file name as a dta file\n    save \"filepath/dtafiles/`cleanfilename'_raw.dta\", replace\n}\nNote that the new .dta files are no longer saved in the same folder that your raw excel, csv, or any other type of files were saved in. As the imported data is no longer raw, they should be saved in either a temporary or data folder.\nIt can be helpful set up a “dta” or “temp” folder for you to save these intermediate data files before you start. To do so, you can create a folder to save your files in directly in your script by using mkdir \"filepath\". If the directory already exists, this will create an error. One solution is to use the capture command and type cap mkdir \"filepath\" which will suppress the error. We recommend avoiding capture in most situations.",

    "text": "Data structure and reshaping\n\nWide and Long Data\nOne way to describe data is if the dataset is stored in a “long” or “wide” format. Long data keeps repeated values as an observation (row):\n\n\n\nHousehold ID\nMember ID\nTreatment\n\n\n\n\nHH001\n01\nT\n\n\nHH001\n02\nC\n\n\n\nWide data describes data that has similar values as variables (columns). The same example could be displayed wide by expanding the Member ID column to be a suffix of the Treatment column, like the following:\n\n\n\nHousehold ID\nTreatment_01\nTreatment_02\n\n\n\n\nHH001\nT\nC\n\n\n\nThere is no correct choice for how data should be stored. You should decided the format to make the data most usable for the analysis being conducted. As a rule of thumb, in a clean dataset each observation is a row, each variable is a column, and each type of observation is a separate dataset (Wickham, 2014). However, the unit of analysis may change for different analyses. An analysis could be conducted at the person-year-level in one analysis, but at the person-level in another. The context of the data being analyzed are required to determine what format the data should be stored in. As long as an ID variable exists for each level of the data (e.g. a long dataset may have a household ID and a household member ID). For more guidance on how Stata treats “wide” and “long” datasets as well as how to change between them (reshape the data) type help reshape in Stata.\nWhen cleaning data, it’s generally a good idea to decide how the data will be stored based on how it will be cleaned. For example, if one goal of cleaning is to produce an income variable at the household-level, but income is collected at the respondent-day-level, it may be a good idea to clean the income module separately and keep that dataset long. Then, the income data can be collapsed to the household-level and merged onto the household-level dataset later in the variable construction process. How, or if, that happens is up to you as the analyst.\nThere is one point at which the data has a known unit of analysis: during high frequency checks and backchecks. Data is always at the unit of the survey submission when doing quality control. One observation is one survey submission. For multi-day surveys, a survey submission may be a different level of data than the survey.\n\n\nSurveyCTO Data\nWhen downloading from SurveyCTO, you can choose whether to export the data in wide or long format. SurveyCTO also produces a file dataset that links long formatted datasets on their unique IDs if the data is exported long.\nKeeping the data in long format means that SurveyCTO will automatically organize observations at the largest unit level (e.g. household-level) and will save all sub-unit level data into separate datasets for each repeat group (e.g. person-level, plot-level, etc.). This means you will have a larger number of datasets to work with (and perhaps a more involved merging process if you want to compile all the data), but each dataset will be at the unit of the question, so may be more intuitive to work with.\nWide data saves you the process of merging manually. If any repeat groups exist, sub-unit level data will automatically be reshaped in order to fit with the main dataset. For example, names of individual household members collected by the variable name will be reshaped as name_1 (for the first member), name_2 (for the second member), etc. It is easier to run quality checks on wide data, as these data will contain all data collected by the survey. However, these datasets can also grow very large very quickly and become unwieldy to work with. To load wide data into Stata it may be necessary to increase the number of variables Stata can read in a single dataset (up to 32,767 for Stata-SE) by typing set maxvar 32767\n\n\nAlternative to reshape\nTo convert between wide and long data, Stata uses the reshape command. Reshaping is a very computationally intensive command. If you are dealing with a large data set you will quickly find that using reshape can take an excessively long time or even break the current Stata session. There is an alternative way to manually code a reshape using expand and replace, that has the benefits of running much faster. It also provides an understanding of how a reshape transforms your data structure. In addition, variable labels can be modified with more control if done manually.\nThe following code reshapes a wide dataset by person to a long dataset by person-month. The variable that we want to reshape is income.\n/*sCount all of the income variables and create\na variable for each observations*/\nds income*\nlocal copies : word count `r(varlist)'\nexpand `copies'\n\n/*Then create a list of all of the vars with each stub\n and manually expand*/\ngen yearmonth = . // create an empty var that will hold the sub-group identifier (this is the j var in reshape)\nforeach var in income {\n\n    *Save all of the income variables\n    ds `var'_*,\n    local reshapevarlist `r(varlist)'\n\n    /*remove the stub so that we can have the yearmonth\n    or j identifier foreach var alone while maintaining their order*/\n    local monthyear = subinstr(\"`reshapevarlist'\", \"`var'_\", \"\", .)\n\n    *create an empty version of the stub, this will become the long var\n    gen `var' = .\n\n    *Loop through each value\n    forvalues x = 1/`copies' {\n\n        * Replace the variable from the list we defined earlier in the loop\n        /* See \"h mod\" to understand how mod works,\n        but in short \"if mod(n, `copies') == `x'\"\"\n        will only replace the variable for the nth observation\n        in each group defined by\n        an ID variable (e.g. the nth or last row created in the expand)\n        */\n        local currvar : word `x' of `reshapevarlist'\n        replace `var' = `currvar' if mod(_n, `copies') == `x'\n\n        * Generate the identifier variable\n        local yearmonth : word `x' of `monthyear'\n        replace yearmonth = `yearmonth' if mod(_n, `copies') == `x'\n\n        *Drop the wide variable\n        drop `currvar'\n    }\n    // end forval x= 1/`copies'\n}\n// end foreach var in income",

    "section": "Adding or replacing data",
    "text": "Adding or replacing data\nRaw data may not contain the full or correct set of data. There are many reasons why this may be the case: survey responses may need to be corrected by enumerators, translations for responses need to be added, admin data may have entry errors, etc. It is relatively simple to make changes in data using statistical software, but it is important to make changes in a systematic way to ensure all modifications are reproducible.\nThere are at least two common situations in IPA projects where having a standardized data flow for modifying or adding data will increase data quality: replacements and translations. This article suggests best practices to add data collected outside of a survey form.\n\nReplacements\nAs you are collecting data, there will inevitably be errors in your data that need to be manually corrected. It is important to always maintain the raw dataset with the original collected data. Once you have confirmed that a value in your dataset is incorrect and needs to be changed, this replacement should be made and saved in a new dataset, before you have done any other necessary cleaning.\nWhen making a replacement, confirm that you are using a truly unique value for your observation. For example, the key variable should be used if you are making replacements in SurveyCTO data, since there can be duplicates in your ID variable, or you may need to make a replacement in the ID variable.\nFor every replacement you make to your dataset, you must record:\n\nWho made the original error\nWho confirmed it was an error\nThe original value\nThe new value\nThe reason for the change\n\nOne way to make replacements is using the replace command if the key variable matches the observation.\n*enum confirmed they added an extra zero to income\nreplace income = 1000 if key == \"uuid:2b2763e1-71b6-4e1e-8023-c15cdf7fa39d\"\nIf you are making multiple replacements, this method can create long datasets and make it difficult to keep track of which replacements have been made. It can also lead to PII appearing in your do files if you are making replacements on PII data or sensitive data. To avoid encrypting your datasets, consider using user-written commands readreplace or ipacheckreadreplace (ipacheckreadreplace is a wrapper for readreplace). Both commands use an Excel file as an input sheet, where all replacements, notes, original values, and replacements are logged. ipacheckreadreplace has a template replacements Excel file that you can download when you run the ipacheck command.\nIf you are using IPA’s Data Management System, this code snippet is included in the master_check do file. You can also use the ipacheckreadreplace command in your own code with this format:\nipacheckreadreplace using \"hfc_replacements.xlsm\", ///\n    id(\"key\") ///\n    variable(\"variable\") ///\n    value(\"value\") ///\n    newvalue(\"newvalue\") ///\n    action(\"action\") ///\n    comments(\"comments\") ///\n    sheet(\"sheetname\") ///\n    logusing(\"replacements_log.xlsx\")\nThe Excel template already uses these column names, so you must change the options/column names if you are using your own file or column names. ipacheckreadreplace also creates a replacements log, another Excel file that lists all the replacements, notes, and values, as well as a note that specifies if the replacement was successful. A replacement will only be successful in ipacheckreadreplace if the unique ID variable and the original value match what was entered in hfc_replacements.xlsx.\n\n\nTranslation\nSometimes open survey responses need to be translated for deliverables or to support an analyst who isn’t fluent in the survey language. Translating these data within statistical software can result in long scripts with large potential for error rates and a potential to contain PII. This can be avoided by using an excel-based workflow with encrypted translation file:\n\nFor each variable that needs to be translated, save the values that need translation to an excel sheet with an empty column (variable in the Stata .dta) for the language the responses need to be translated into.\nTranslate the responses using a standardized procedure, e.g. double-entry with another person breaking ties and rules on when to drop comments with PII.\nWrite code to merge the translation from the excel file back into the do file, instead of running this as a series of replace commands that are prone to error.\n\nThis workflow is shown below:\n/* MR 10/25/2019:\n  Create a file to store translations for question q.\n*/\n\n*Generate translated variable name\ngen q_en = \"\"\nlocal vlab : variable label q // extract variable label to copy\nlabel variable q_en \"`vlab', English\" // label with translation info\n\n*Save excel file for coding with only those questions that need translating\nexport excel id q q_en using \"${temp}/q_en.xlsx\" if !mi(q), firstrow(variables) replace\nThis results in a table that looks like this:\n\n\n\nid\nq\nq_en\n\n\n\n\n01-0001\nLe dio sus herramientas agrícolas a su primo\n\n\n\n18-0007\nEl ID de esta respuesta debe set 18-0008, no 18-0007\n\n\n\n\nThe responses would be translated and then the file is then saved with a different name. We recommend saving the file as “[filename]_translated_[date]_[initials]”. We recommend doing double entry for all manual additions and comparing differences between any added responses. The completed file would have a value for every question below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nq\nq_en\n\n\n\n\n01-0001\nLe dio sus herramientas agrícolas a su primo.\nThis respondent gave their farming tools to their cousin\n\n\n18-0007\nEl ID de esta respuesta debe set 18-0008, no 18-0007\nThe ID of this response should be 18-0008, not 18-0007\n\n\n\nOnce these translations are completed, they would be merged on to the do file. The code to complete that looks like this:\n/* MR 01/24/20:\n    Merge on the translated data from the saved excel file.\n\n    MR translated these data on January 24, 2020 and double entered them.\n    MR's RM double checked conflicting translated entries.\n\n    If PII was removed as part of the translation process, this will be\n    marked with a dummy* and corrected in the response of both languages.\n\n    *Note: no responses needed PII removal, so this code does not\n    create the dummy.\n*/\n*Load in data and save a tempfile\npreserve\n\nimport excel using \"${temp}/q_en_20200124_MR.xlsx\", first clear\n\n*Do some cleaning to ensure excel files matches expected\nmissing dropvars, force // remove extravars\nmissing dropobs, force // remove empty observations\nconfirm variable id q q_en // check have variables\n\n*Save tempfile to merge\ntempfile q_en\nsave `q_en'\n\nrestore\n\n*Merge on file\nmmerge id using `q_en', t(1:1) uname(check_)\n\n*Check file\nassert _merge == 1 | _merge == 3 // in master only or translated\nassert q == check_q if _merge == 3 // ensure no changes to comment field\nassert _merge == 3 if !mi(q) // ensure all are translated\n\n*Manually replace translation after checks\nreplace q_en = check_q_en\n\n*Housecleaning\ndrop _merge check_q check_q_en\nThis process can be repeated for any number of variables. It can also be extended to remove PII as part of the translation process. In that case, make sure to maintain a raw version of the dataset that is encrypted, and mark which values were changed to remove PII in the translated dataset.",

    "section": "SurveyCTO split",
    "text": "SurveyCTO split\nSome surveys questions have the option of “check all that apply,” meaning that they allow for multiple responses. If you uncheck the “export select_multiple responses as a series of 1/0 columns” in SurveyCTO desktop, SurveyCTO will export these variables as a string containing all possible answers in the form of a space-separated list (e.g., a variable may have the string “A C E” to indicate responses of A, C, and E).\nFor analysis purposes, it’s usually best to split these variables into binary variables, one for each possible choice (A, B, C, D, or E), as well as one for each combination of choices. The IPA-written stringdum function can help converting these variables to a more useful form, including separate dummies for each option, variables that count the number of times each option is selected, and several options for naming conventions. The split command can also convert these variables, by parsing the variable on spaces. This splits the variable into a new variable after each space (see help split). If this is not sufficient, Stata has a number of string functions (help string functions). You can also use the regexm function to accomplish this, which uses regular expressions. Below is an example script using both split and regexm to accomplish cleaning a select multiple question manually.\n* Create a local of all string variables\nqui ds _all, has(type string)\nforeach var in `r(varlist)' {\n    local stringvars `stringvars' `var'\n}\n\n\n/* Exclude from stringvars vars with names that will be too long if we append\n  four characters (\"_num\") to them first check using tab that they are not\n  select_mult.

    "title": "Raw Data Management",
    "section": "Unique identifiers",
    "text": "Unique identifiers\nUnique IDs are critical to a well-managed dataset, particularly when it comes time to merge across datasets or sort values in a consistent manner. You should use the isid command in Stata to check that the ID is indeed unique before you begin any sort of data management. Uniqueness is important not just to describe data, but because it affects how Stata manages data. Data will take a random order within a non-unique value if data are sorted on a shared identifier. This randomness is controlled by a separate random seed in Stata and can be made reproducible using set sortseed or sort, stable. Those approaches do not substitute for not having a unique ID; reproducibility is not a substitute for uniqueness.\nTo illustrate this, you can run the following code in Stata:\n*Use system dataset\nset sortseed 1\nsysuse auto, clear\n\n*sort by foreign and save order\nsort foreign\ngen sort_order = _n\n\n*sort randomly so Stata will sort by foreign again\n/*  sort first checks if it's in order, and doesn't do anything if\n    the data are in the expected order\n*/\ngen rand = runiform()\nsort rand\ndrop rand\n\n*Check if foreign has a unique order\nsort foreign\nassert _n == sort_order // check if the current order == saved order\n\n73 contradictions in 74 observations\nassertion is false\nr(9);\n\nDuplicates\nID variable should describe data at the unit of analysis. The unit of analysis is dependent on what the dataset is describing. For example, a survey module that describes yield by plot should not be unique at the household-level, but should be at the household-plot-level. That is equivalent to saying that isid householdid plotid should not return an error in Stata. If you receive an error, use the duplicates command to investigate as to why you have duplicate observations (help duplicates). Although duplicate surveys should be resolved in IPA’s data management system, duplicate observations may remain in the raw data for a variety of reasons.\nIf they are true duplicates across all variables and it is clear why these duplicates were created, you can proceed to remove duplicate copies. If they are not duplicates across all variables, you will need to find why there are multiple observations and develop a rule for choosing which one to keep. Selected values should be reproducible and follow a consistent rule. In general, observations that are more recent and more informative (i.e., have fewer missing values) are better. However, for some projects, it is better to keep the earlier observation. You should check with your PI, the project manager and other staff involved in the survey wave about how to create a rules or rules. Once you come up with a decision, be sure to document both what you decide to do and why it was decided, as well as when and who made the decision for future reference.\nDuplicates may not just exist for an ID variable. Some respondents may take a survey twice and receive two different IDs. See help duplicates for guidance on commands that can be useful for this. Apart from dropping duplicates in terms of all variables using duplicates drop, check for duplicates in terms of things you suspect may identify the same person (e.g., name, address, phone number, birthday and combinations of the above) using either duplicates or isid.\nAfter cleaning each dataset individually, check that the unique IDs are assigned correctly across datasets. For instance, if you have a baseline survey and an endline survey, after merging them based on unique ID, check that the names and birthdate variables from each survey match to the other survey.\n\n\nID formats\nIDs may not be unique due to how Stata manages numerical formats. If the ID variable is longer than 17 digits, numeric IDs will no longer be unique as Stata will begin to round the trailing digits. This is due to how Stata stores when they have more digits than their storage type can hold (16 for doubles). No numeric IDs will be unique if they have more than 17 digits, especially if the last digits are changing for individuals that should be unique. Store IDs as strings and include a letter to ensure that the ID will not be turned into a numeric variable and subsequently rounded by compress or destring. Alternatively, keep ID values at the minimum length needed, as it is not necessary to have an ID value over 17 digits.",

    "text": "De-identifying data\nPersonally Identifiable Information – also known as PII – is any datapoint or combination of datapoints that allows someone to identify an individual or household with a reasonable degree of certainty.\nExamples of individual data points of PII include names, GPS coordinates, national identification numbers and addresses. Depending on the context, certain combinations of demographic data points qualify as PII so long as they can identify an individual or household with a reasonable degree of certainty. For example, the combination of village name, birth date, gender might be identifiable in small communities. Requirements and recommendations around PII apply equally to PII that consist of singular data points and those that consist of combinations of data points.\nAll PII must remain encrypted in storage and securely transmitted between devices. The only people who can access PII data must be both on the IRB-approved research protocol and referenced in the informed consent. For more information, see IPA’s protocols surrounding PII\n\nWhen to remove PII\nAfter you have data, it’s best practice to remove PII as soon as possible. The earlier you can de-identify the better. Unless necessary, avoid working with data containing PII as you move forward with analysis.\nSome aspects of cleaning and analysis will require including PII. For instance, if you are trying to remove duplicate observations and need to determine if two respondents have the same name, you’ll want that in there. As always, you will need to keep the data encrypted with Boxcryptor at that point. Make sure do-files/scripts are encrypted as well if they include PII.\nAfter you no longer need PII, strip it from the main dataset. The best practice for de-identifying data is to:\n\nCreate a first .do file that imports the data, standardizes duplicate observations, completes corrections, and removes PII.\nCreate a second .do file that performs the data cleaning on the limited or fully deidentified dataset. If need be, you can save this version in an unencrypted folder so that other project members who can access the data.\n\nThis results in a data flow where all data modification happens after the data is deidentified.",

    "text": "What is a Rapid Ethnographic Assessment?\nRapid Ethnographic Assessments (REA) are a qualitative research method that allows researchers to collect information efficiently for decision-making. This methodology has several key features1:\n\n\nConduct participant observations: To approach the internal perspective of individuals in specific situations, from everyday life and the researcher’s own experiences during events.\nUse of field notes: To condense the preliminary results from various data collection techniques such as focus groups, interviews, and observations. These field notes include dense descriptions and reflective statements documenting the fieldwork, along with personal reflections.\nEstablish relationships with the community or participants: REA builds on the premise that researchers can obtain extensive and in-depth information through short, intensive and participatory fieldwork with the community. This participatory aspect ensures active engagement and involvement.\nSeek social and cultural relationships within a group of people: REA emphasizes on understanding individual daily activities and group’s culture, norms, activities, and social relations. In contrast to classic approaches, it offers a more specific focus, a shorter duration, and limited scope.\nHolistic approach to the topics studied: Conducting an REA allows researchers to connect qualitative data collection techniques and other available data sources to generate insights efficiently. Researchers obtain these insights through their interpretations. REA focuses not on objectivity but on identifying high-quality relationships among people, stories, and events mapped in the field.\n\n\nThese principles have their roots in classical ethnography, which aims to understand a problem or situation from the “insider’s” or “subject’s perspective.” Unlike classical ethnographies that involve extensive time—months or years—in the field, researchers execute Rapid Ethnographic Assessments in a short period and aim to tell decision-makers timely. Some authors suggest conducting REA over four to six weeks.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining multiple data-collection techniques\n\n\n\nWith rapid ethnographies, researchers collect information mainly through qualitative techniques, such as interviews, focus groups, and observations. However, researchers can also use quantitative techniques, such as available data and short surveys, to support answers to research questions.3 To achieve relevant insights, REAs feature triangulation of results, consolidation of multidisciplinary teams, and iterative learning processes.4 Combining multiple techniques positions rapid ethnography as a tool that provides findings and recommendations based on detailed, culturally relevant information reflecting local realities.\n\n\n\nWhen to consider doing a REA?\nREAs are particularly useful when practical and actionable recommendations are needed within short time frames. While this methodology has great potential, the rapid collection and processing mean that REA findings are exploratory. Their scope focuses on identifying findings from particular contexts rather than generating generalizable knowledge. REA is especially useful when:\n\nMore information is needed about an emerging problem or situation with little existing knowledge: Rapid ethnographies can provide descriptive information about complex problems, helping to identify causes and design appropriate interventions.\nEngagement with “hidden” or vulnerable populations is necessary: Some populations may be particularly closed and difficult to reach. Accessing these groups requires the support of trusted individuals within the community. Rapid ethnographies often seek to identify and involve these community leaders to facilitate contact and build trust during the research.\nCommunity involvement is essential: Understanding how to address a problem requires the involvement of local community members. Involving the people who are directly affected by a problem often results in more practical and achievable recommendations for the program or intervention.\n\nBelow are three real-world applications of rapid ethnographic assessments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Health\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans experienced a demographic increase in the Latino population, particularly among single, undocumented men. Researchers suspected an emerging pattern of crack use among this population but needed more information to formulate responses. The REA results revealed how contextual factors such as a growing drug market, coupled with social isolation and victimization of the undocumented Latino population, led to the initiation and increase in crack use among a group that previously had relatively low drug use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing vulnerable migrant and refugee populations presents challenges due to stigmatization from irregular migratory status, lack of documentation, and distrust toward state institutions. Rapid ethnographies enabled strategic approaches with community leaders and migrant organizations within local communities. Their involvement proved fundamental in building community trust and accessing the target population, making participants feel included and valued in the process.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween November 2020 and January 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers conducted a REA in Dhaka, Bangladesh. They used in-depth interviews and participant observations to explore health-related beliefs and practices. The REA revealed a gap between scientific explanations of COVID-19 and the community’s cultural and spiritual beliefs, such as the perception of the virus as a disease of the rich and sinners, leading many to reject biosecurity measures. These findings highlighted the need for deeper understanding of community perceptions to improve public health policy effectiveness.6",

    "section": "Planning a REA",
    "text": "Planning a REA\n\n\nAssess the relevance of the methodology\n\n\nBefore starting a rapid ethnographic assessment, it is crucial to determine if this methodology is suitable for your research objectives. Consider the following questions:\n\nDoes the research require in-depth, qualitative insights within a short timeframe? Rapid ethnographies are designed to provide timely, actionable data.\nAre there specific cultural or social dynamics that need to be understood quickly? This method is particularly useful for exploring complex social interactions and cultural contexts.\nIs there a need for participatory engagement with the community? Rapid ethnographies emphasize active involvement and collaboration with community members.\nAre the necessary resources and expertise available? Ensure that your team has the skills and tools required to conduct qualitative research effectively.\n\nIf the answers to these questions align with your research needs, rapid ethnography may be an appropriate choice. The data produced during REA is gathered through a combination of various data collection techniques. The information and resources obtained from these techniques can be presented in a variety of formats. This interactive process involves the use of:\n\nAudio recordings from interviews and focus groups\nPhotographs and videos taken during observation activities\nTexts resulting from note-taking during activities\nOther resources such as maps or drawings provided by the community\n\nThe mechanism of interaction between resources and the process on how that information contributes to generate insights depends on the scope of research questions and the strategy designed by the researcher to address rich information with time constraints.\n\n\nAdditional considerations for conducting a REA\n\n\n\nDuration: Although there is no set rule on how much time is sufficient to conduct it, most experts agree that the time spent in the field collecting data should be between two and six weeks.7 The speed of data collection will depend on research objectives, funding, and team technical expertise. Remember that a key aspect of rapid ethnographies is to produce actionable and timely data for decision-makers. If the timeline is not feasible and available funding is limited, another method may be more appropriate. Key questions to consider include: When are the findings needed? Can the timeline be met? Are the necessary technical and financial resources available?\nEthical considerations: Ensure that appropriate IRB permits and certifications are in place if required. This measure ensures that the research will not harm people and communities due to the project’s processes or findings.\nData collection techniques: Identify data collection techniques that will be prioritized Here, consider the information you want to collect and consult the practical guidelines for focus groups, interviews, and observations, as these are the most common collection techniques in REA. However, depending on the research needs and the research team’s experience, other collection techniques such as ethnographic mapping or short surveys can be implemented (For detailed data collection techniques used in rapid ethnographies, see Annex 1).\n\n\n\nStructure your team\n\n\nWhen structuring your team, carefully consider who will make up an effective and productive team. Take into account the experience required for each role and ensure that team members are well-suited to the tasks they will perform in the field. To achieve this, define who will be in the field and the characteristics that each team member should have. The best multidisciplinary teams comprise people with complementary skills and technical or subject matter expertise. In addition, teamwork has been identified as beneficial, as it facilitates the development of ethnographic research from different points of view, often integrating knowledge from various fields, areas, or topics.8 Three essential elements of a strong team are (i) expertise in qualitative methods, (ii) expertise in content or topics, and (iii) expertise in the local context.9\nThere should be at least one person on the project team with experience in qualitative research methods. This person should be responsible for helping to keep the project on track by monitoring the quality of the data collected and training team members when necessary. This role will facilitate learning from participants due to their ethnographic orientation and sensitivity to the project.10\nIt is also highly recommended to have people with thematic expertise and actively involve stakeholders. Thematic experts could guide the research team in understanding the findings nuances and connecting it with literature, as well as provide institutional context, depending on the study topic. In turn, stakeholders can act as advisors throughout the study, ensuring relevance and facilitating the incorporation of findings into practical changes.11\nIn addition, the team should include people who are closely involved on a daily basis with the problem or phenomenon under study. These are usually people from the local community or target population. These people are sometimes called “cultural experts.” They should be a trusted person who can help facilitate access and interaction with hard-to-reach populations and provide information on how things are organized within their community.12\nFinally, assign roles and functions to each team member. Before starting the collection, define the roles and functions of the field team. Some key roles and functions must be assigned to achieve the proposed objectives. To do this, make a role assignment matrix to organize the tasks of contacting or scheduling participants, logistics of access to the territory, information collection, data flow closure, and analysis.\n\n\nRecognize the skills of the field team13\n\n\nThe quality of data produced during qualitative research activities is closely related to the skills of the moderator and facilitator. These competencies, outlined in Table 1, enable teams to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within qualitative data.\nWhile these skills are typically developed through years of study and practice, field teams often consist of individuals from multidisciplinary backgrounds with varying levels of experience. Regardless of experience level, it is important to review and discuss these skills with your team to identify possible gaps and opportunities for improvement.\nCurrently, there are no standardized metrics to measure the prevalence of these skills among qualitative fieldwork moderators. Therefore, the skills in Table 1 should be viewed as a resource for reference and reflection for teams.\nEnsuring that everyone on the team understands how these competencies contribute to effectively engaging with the population is essential for collecting high-quality information.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Skills of field staff conducting a REA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\nDescription\nWhy is this skill important?\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within\nAllows researchers to connect more deeply with participant’s realities and experiences. Helps to create a relationship of trust and respect with the participants. Seeks to avoid generalizations and stereotypes that may arise from preconceptions or external influences such as previous studies. Enhances understanding of participants’ situations without resorting to pity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. Contributes to obtaining deeper responses from participants. Enables exploration of emerging themes during data collection. Helps in detecting and validating patterns observed in the field.\n\n\nSelf-awareness and reflexivity\nThe field team’s ability to continuously reflect on how their presence, background, and assumptions influence data collection, interpretation, and analysis. This ongoing self-reflection ensures that the qualitative field team is mindful of its impact on the research process and the participants.\nHelps maintain ethics in the researcher-participant relationship. Facilitates understanding of personal limitations in connecting with participants. Aids in developing strategies to overcome communication barriers and create an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nThe field team’s ability to represent and reflect the diversity within the group being studied. This skill involves recognizing and documenting the differences and variations among individuals or subgroups during qualitative research, typically applied during the data analysis phase.\nContributes to challenging generalized and simplistic patterns. Ensures that data reflect both common and atypical experiences. Demonstrates the field team’s ability to identify, recognize, and document heterogeneity in the population studied.\n\n\nPalpability\nThe field team’s ability to provide detailed descriptions in their field notes or diaries, making the data tangible and clear. This involves avoiding abstract descriptions and, instead, offering vivid accounts that allow the research team to visualize and understand participants’ experiences and contexts.\nThe palpable field notes and diaries are accompanied by textual quotations, images, or other audiovisual resources that show events, situations, and actors that support the research findings. Reliable findings are supported by specific details that clearly depict the events and situations studied. Helps to avoid abstraction in the data, grounding conclusions in concrete evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan logistics activities\n\n\n\nContact allies, leaders, and key actors: Engage with local partners to understand contextual factors, convene participants, and coordinate logistics. Local partners can facilitate data collection.\nMake a schedule defining the field collection activities:: Define all field collection activities, the total number of tasks to be completed, and the time available; Share the schedule with allies and key stakeholders to; Confirm participant availability on the selected dates; Identify locations where activities will take place.; Ensure there are no conflicting events in the community; Use visual tools such as a Gantt chart for developing the schedule.\nVerify the location and conditions of the places where the collection activities will take place: Identify safe locations that facilitate interaction with the community. Work with local community organizations and leaders if possible. Gather general field information and visit the community with someone locally trusted to establish rapport and familiarize yourself with the area.\nEnsure the safety of the field team: Conduct a thorough risk assessment during the planning phase. Prioritize the safety of both the field team and the community to minimize risks.\nEnsure that you have all the necessary materials to carry out the activities: Prepare incentives for participants (if applicable). Arrange refreshments, stationery, attendance lists, informed consents (if applicable), recording equipment, photographic equipment, batteries, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheduling REA activities\n\n\n\nA field collection activity lasts, on average, two to three hours. Therefore, a maximum of two activities per day is recommended. This ensures data quality, does not exhaust the field team or the community, and avoids losing focus due to fatigue or saturation. In addition, the schedule of activities should include the time allocated by the team to:\n\nTravel or transport to the collection sites\nCollect data\nTake notes\nRefine the field notes and integrate other resources generated\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan to ensure effective fieldwork and secure storage of gathered information\n\n\nIn addition to logistical planning, the team must decide how to handle the collection and secure management of data to ensure its quality and facilitate its subsequent systematization. To this end:\n\nDefine who will lead data collection and reception within the team: One person should lead the instrument design, data collection, resources reception (based on fieldwork results), and analysis. Ideally, this person should have experience applying qualitative research methods and be involved in fieldwork and data collection. This person’s involvement in the project’s different stages will make it easier to manage the information collected and ensure the integration of the various sources and resources.\nDefine a note-taking strategy for the different activities: Note-taking is essential across all data collection activities in REA, even if recordings are available. The team leader should agree with the team on things like the format that everyone will use for their note-taking, critical aspects that require more or less attention from the team to address in the notes, types of formats that could complement the notes (photographs, videos, maps, etc.), and the dates for intermediate and final results. Overall, Having a common understanding of these processes will ensure the smooth flow of data collection and a clear scope of each role within the team.\nStudy the instruments, scripts, and practical guides provided to ensure data quality during data collection: Before fieldwork, all team members should familiarize themselves with the characteristics of the instruments and the type of notes and supplementary resources to be generated in each case. Use the practical guides provided to prepare accordingly for the prioritized techniques.",

During fieldwork, the team should meet periodically to share insights and determine if adjustments are needed for upcoming activities. These debriefing sessions are a key component of rapid ethnography and should be scheduled to ensure they are not overlooked. Some guiding Questions for Check-Ins include:\n\nWere there any unexpected or stressful events?\nHow well did you perform as an interviewer, moderator, observer, or note-taker?\nWhat kind of data did you collect?\nAre there any gaps that need follow-up?\nWhat adjustments would you make to the data collection guides or techniques?\nAre there new sites or contexts that need observation?\nTake notes during these meetings to track follow-up actions. These sessions are also a chance to discuss the project’s progress, address logistical challenges, and provide team members with training or advice on collection techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of check-ins\n\n\n\nDue to time constraints, it’s tempting to skip check-ins or leave discussions for after fieldwork is complete—this is a mistake!\nSharing information in a group setting improves the quality of data collection and subsequent analysis.

    "text": "Digital Ethnographies\nThe internet and digital technologies have accelerated the way people live, work, and relate to each other. In response to this social phenomenon, digital ethnography has emerged, a method that studies how people behave and interact in virtual environments, creating communities in digital spaces.16\nDigital ethnography adapts traditional ethnographic research techniques to studying online cultures and communities formed through communications mediated by a computer or mobile device. Instead of physically being in a community, researchers immerse themselves in online communities, forums, and social networking platforms. This way, the digital ethnographer observes and analyzes how individuals interact in these virtual spaces.17\nTechniques commonly used in digital ethnography are participant and non-participant observation, interviews, focus groups, and short surveys. To conduct a digital ethnography, follow the steps described above for performing a rapid ethnography. In addition, these considerations will be useful when adapting this method to a digital environment.18\n\n\n\nTable 3: Challenges (and solutions) for digital REAs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nSolutions and recommendations\n\n\n\n\nEthical concerns: Informed consent\nObtaining informed consent from online participants can be challenging.\nWhenever possible, contact participants and share and socialize the informed consent. Some platforms may have specific terms of service, but it is essential to ensure that participants understand the research and agree to participate voluntarily.\n\n\nEthical concerns: anonymity and privacy\nProtecting the privacy and anonymity of participants in virtual environments is becoming more complex.\nSome platforms may have specific terms of service and data processing. Please review these terms. Researchers should tell participants if they intend to share information so that appropriate measures can be taken and the risk of participant identification minimized if the participant does not wish to be identified.\n\n\nDigital divide: Disparities in access\nNot everyone can access the internet or digital devices equally.\nBe mindful of access gaps that may lead to a biased sample, excluding certain demographic groups and limiting the generalizability of the findings.\n\n\nDigital divide: Low digital literacy\nParticipants may have no or low skills in handling technological devices, which may affect their online behaviors.\nThese differences should be considered when presenting findings during the data analysis and interpretation phases. When using WhatsApp, use the application’s various resources, such as voice notes, images, videos, and stickers, to convey information accurately, directly, and responsively to users with these difficulties.\n\n\nData quality and authenticity: Incorrect representation\nParticipants may present themselves differently online, creating a potential gap between their online persona and offline identity.\nNote that automated accounts, trolls, and fake profiles can complicate data interpretation and introduce biased information into the analysis. Always be aware of the potential for misrepresentation in digital environments.\n\n\nLow participation: Interaction at problematic times\nParticipants may need help participating in the activities due to schedule conflicts or lack of time availability.\nConduct baseline surveys to identify the schedules that best meet the population’s needs. From the beginning, underline clear rules about desirable times to receive messages.\n\n\nLow participation: Lack of trust\nParticipants may be distrustful of being artificially linked to virtual communities.\nMake prior contact with participants before linking them to virtual spaces to introduce them to the organization. Present again the purpose of the research. Sometimes, participants do not complete the informed consent form.\n\n\nInterpretation: Difficulty in interpreting content\nMessages shared by participants may present an interpretive challenge for the researcher, as the tone of the message is attributed by the reader.\nActively moderate to ask counter-questions to clarify the message. Promote clear communication in written messages. Record questions arising from participation in virtual scenarios from participant interactions in your field diary or field note.",

    "section": "About qualitative research",
    "text": "About qualitative research\nQualitative research methods are tools for exploring the how and why behind human actions, decisions, and experiences. Unlike quantitative approaches, which focus on numbers and statistical trends, qualitative methods delve into words, narratives, and visual data to uncover rich, contextual insights. These methods are particularly valuable for understanding the complexities of poverty and the effectiveness of interventions.\nAddressing poverty is about more than measuring income or access to resources; it is about understanding the underlying social, cultural, and psychological factors that perpetuate it. Qualitative methods help researchers:\n\nUnderstand Context: Explore how local norms, values, and practices influence the impact of programs.\nAmplify Voices: Capture the perspectives of marginalized groups who are often overlooked in traditional studies.\nDesign Better Interventions: Use insights to tailor programs that meet the specific needs of target populations.\nEvaluate Impact: Unpack the mechanisms behind why interventions succeed or fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualitative research at IPA\n\n\n\nAt IPA, qualitative research plays a vital role in designing, implementing, and evaluating programs aimed at reducing poverty. Here are some examples:\n\nFinancial Inclusion Studies: Interviews and focus groups with low-income individuals to understand barriers to saving, borrowing, and using financial products.\nEducation Interventions: Ethnographic studies in schools to explore teacher-student dynamics and identify strategies to improve learning outcomes.\nHealth Programs: In-depth interviews with caregivers and healthcare workers to assess the cultural acceptability of new health interventions.\nGender Dynamics: Case studies to explore how social norms and power structures affect women’s participation in economic programs.\n\n\n\nQualitative research does not stand alone—it complements quantitative methods to create a more holistic understanding. For example, qualitative data can explain anomalies in survey results, uncover mechanisms of change in randomized controlled trials or RCTs, and provide actionable insights for scaling successful programs.\n\n\n\n\nQualitative data collection in Tumaco, Colombia, photo by German Acosta",

    "text": "What is an observation?\nObservations are a qualitative research data collection technique that identifies traits, behaviors, and interactions of individuals and their contexts through the senses and interpretations of the researcher.1 The results of observations typically include detailed descriptions of what the field researcher observed, heard, and interpreted during research activities. Observation is therefore a subjective data collection technique that relies on observation, note-taking, and interpretation skills.2 Researchers can classify observations as either participant or non-participant, depending on how they conduct the fieldwork.\n\nParticipant Observation\nIn participant observation, researchers actively participate and interact in daily activities or specific contexts of the participants.3 This approach allows researchers to gain first-hand understanding of participants’ daily practices, perspectives, and relationships. For example, a researcher might join community leaders on journeys to identify transport needs for accessing a social program.\n\n\nNon-Participant Observation\nIn non-participant observation, the researcher analyzes the behavior and relationships of participants without intervening, or intervening as little as possible, in the context or activity. Observers position themselves in a suitable place to listen and observe interactions without making comments or participating. For example, a researcher might conduct asynchronous remote observations through video recordings to identify how public school teachers reinforce gender stereotypes among students.",

    "section": "Unstructured vs. structured observations",
    "text": "Unstructured vs. structured observations\nIn both participant and non-participant observations, the level of data structuring varies based on the fieldwork approach and the expected research outcomes:\n\nUnstructured Observations\nUnstructured observations use open-ended questions in data collection instruments to obtain highly descriptive and narrative information from the researcher. For example, researchers mapping the challenges of caring for children might attend a guided tour with facilitators who share their experiences and suggest improvements to support children’s well-being. This approach is suitable in certain context described below in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: When to consider unstructured observations 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Research\nWhen the research topic is relatively unknown or when exploring a phenomenon without preconceived notions or rigid frameworks.\n\n\nComplex or Dynamic Settings\nIn environments where behaviors or interactions are complex and unpredictable, allowing the observer to capture a wide range of activities and interactions.\n\n\nContextual Understanding\nWhen aiming for a deep, holistic understanding of a setting, context, or culture without predefined categories.\n\n\nFlexibility Required\nWhen the researcher needs flexibility to follow interesting leads or unexpected occurrences during observation.\n\n\nDeep Immersion\nWhen deeply understanding the culture, practices, and perspectives of a group by experiencing them firsthand.\n\n\n*Hidden Behaviors\nWhen certain behaviors or interactions are not visible to outsiders, requiring the researcher to become part of the group.\n\n\nBuilding Trust\nWhen establishing trust and rapport with participants is essential for obtaining accurate data, best achieved through involvement.\n\n\nSensitive Topics\nWhen studying sensitive or private behaviors that participants may not openly share with an outsider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructured Observations\nStructured observations use closed-ended questions to obtain specific information, resulting in short responses, counts, or responses on scales. For example, researchers might conduct asynchronous observations of recordings to identify how often teachers in public educational institutions reinforce gender stereotypes among young children. As with unstructured observations, structured ones are suitable in certain context described below in Table 2.\n\n\n\nTable 2: When to consider structured observations 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nFocused Research\nWhen the research aims to collect specific, consistent, and comparable data across different settings or subjects.\n\n\nQuantifiable Data Needed\nWhen the researcher needs to quantify behaviors or interactions, making it easier to analyze and compare results.\n\n\nPredefined Variables\nWhen the study has clear research questions or hypotheses, and the researcher knows exactly what behaviors or events to observe and record.\n\n\nConsistency Across Observers\nWhen multiple observers are involved, ensuring consistency in data collection to maintain reliability.\n\n\nObjectivity\nWhen maintaining a level of detachment is important to avoid influencing participants’ behavior.\n\n\nEthical Concerns\nWhen participation might create ethical issues, such as situations where the researcher’s involvement could affect the outcome.\n\n\nNatural Behavior\nWhen observing natural, unaltered behavior is critical, and the presence of a participant observer might alter how people act.\n\n\nLarge Groups\nWhen studying large groups or public behaviors where direct participation isn’t feasible or necessary.\n\n\nComparative Studies\nWhen comparing behaviors across different groups or settings, requiring a consistent, detached observational stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing Between Structured and Unstructured Approaches\nParticipant observations often align with an unstructured approach, as the richness of these activities typically relies on the events, topics, and places that emerge during fieldwork. In contrast, structured observations often align with a non-participant approach, allowing research teams to standardize observations and minimize interference with the context. The choice between structured, unstructured, or mixed approaches depends on the specific needs of the study and its research design. In practice, these approaches are not mutually exclusive, and research teams can combine both during fieldwork.",

    "section": "Planning an observation",
    "text": "Planning an observation\nPreparing for an observation involves several key steps: planning logistical aspects, structuring the team, understanding research objectives and observation instruments, and considering recommendations for implementation. Consider the following logistical elements and resources when planning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand What You Will Observe\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to review the observation matrix or other relevant study materials, paying attention to the following aspects:\n\nObjectives of the observation.\nType of observation to be conducted.\nActivities to be carried out.\nPeople, places, and territories involved in the observation context.\nTiming and extent of the fieldwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Allies, Leaders, and Key Actors\n\n\n\n\n\nFor participant observations, we recommend contacting local people who will accompany the observations, provide context, and facilitate the activities. For non-participant observations, allies or leaders can assist with logistics and offer valuable recommendations to the research team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview Research Ethics and Safe Data Handling Protocols\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo aspects must be taken into account when approaching an observation ethically:\n\nEnsure that all necessary permissions have been obtained from communities and partners involved to conduct observations.\nObtain informed consent from participants, particularly when collecting audio, image, or video records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure You Have an Observation Guide and Note-Taking Format\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the planning phase, you should make sure that:\n\nYou understand how the observation will be conducted.\nYou have adapted the note-taking strategy to the context of the observation—digital or paper.\nYou are clear on the expected outputs at the end of the field activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify the Location and Conditions of the Observation Site\n\n\n\n\n\nSince observations often take place in participants’ everyday environments, it’s essential to ensure that the site is comfortable and suitable for the observation.\n\n\n\n\nStructuring your team\nThe team members who develop the observations vary considerably according to the scope of the research and the resources available to achieve these objectives.\nObservation teams should ideally consist of at least two members who conduct observations together. Having multiple observers broadens the perspectives on the observed contexts and enhances the collection of resources, such as audiovisual material. However, if budget constraints limit the number of observers, this may affect the quality of the activity and the data collected. Additional participants might be necessary, especially in sensitive or high-security contexts. When structuring your team, consider how individual observer characteristics might influence data collection. The team should reflect on which aspects might introduce bias or cause resistance from the population being studied. Understanding the context and the population is crucial for this exercise.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Desirable Skills of the Field Team\nThe quality of data produced during qualitative research activities relates to the skills of the moderator and facilitator.6 These competencies, outlined in Table 3, enable teams to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within qualitative data. While these skills are typically developed through years of study and practice, field teams often consist of individuals from multidisciplinary backgrounds with varying levels of experience. Regardless of experience level, it is important to review and discuss these skills with your team to identify possible gaps and opportunities for improvement.\nCurrently, no standardized metrics exist to measure the prevalence of these skills among qualitative fieldwork moderators. Therefore, teams should view the skills below as a resource for reference and reflection. Ensuring that everyone on the team understands how these competencies contribute to engaging with the population is essential for collecting high-quality information.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Desirable skills in the field team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility\nDescription\nWhy is this skill important?\n\n\n\n\nCognitive empathy\nThe field team’s ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.\nAllows researchers to connect more deeply with participant’s realities and experiences. Helps to create a relationship of trust and respect with the participants. Seeks to avoid generalizations and stereotypes that may arise from preconceptions or external influences such as previous studies. Enhances understanding of participants’ situations without resorting to pity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe field team’s ability to recognize when they need additional information to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.\nIncreases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. Contributes to obtaining deeper responses from participants. Enables exploration of emerging themes during data collection. Helps detect and validate patterns observed in the field.\n\n\nSelf-awareness and reflexivity\nThe field team’s ability to continuously reflect on how their presence, background, and assumptions influence data collection, interpretation, and analysis. This ongoing self-reflection ensures that the qualitative field team is mindful of its impact on the research process and the participants.\nHelps maintain ethics in the researcher-participant relationship. Facilitates understanding of personal limitations in connecting with participants. Aids in developing strategies to overcome communication barriers and create an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing sensitive information.\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nThe field team’s ability to represent and reflect the diversity within the group being studied. This skill involves recognizing and documenting the differences and variations among individuals or subgroups during qualitative research, typically applied during the data analysis phase.\nContributes to challenging generalized and simplistic patterns. Ensures that data reflect both common and atypical experiences. Demonstrates the field team’s ability to identify, recognize, and document heterogeneity in the population studied.\n\n\nPalpability\nThe field team’s ability to provide detailed descriptions in their field notes or diaries, making the data tangible and clear. This involves avoiding abstract descriptions and, instead, offering vivid accounts that allow the research team to visualize and understand participants’ experiences and contexts.\nReliable findings are supported by specific details that clearly depict the events and situations studied. Helps to avoid abstraction in the data, grounding conclusions in concrete evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy the observation guide\nThe resources designed for observation help guide the observer, with varying degrees of structure depending on the research design. Observation guides are characterized by:\n\nAlignment with Research Objectives: The guide should directly relate to the goals of the research.\nIdentification of Key Characteristics: It should clearly identify the characteristics that need to be observed.\nAppropriate Scope: The guide should contain a manageable number of statements for the characteristics being observed, ensuring it is comprehensive but not overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip for note-taking\n\n\n\nYou can use narrative resources, photographs, drawings, or examples to describe participants’ interactions and reactions, as appropriate.\n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the characteristics of the instruments and the type of information you expect to generate – such as field notes, diaries, or activity logs. If you conduct the observation in a group, study the instruments together and agree on the general criteria you wish to observe.",

    "text": "Conducting an observation\nBegin by introducing yourself and clearly explaining each team member’s role and the session’s general dynamics. If appropriate, read the informed consent, ensuring that all participants clearly understand the purpose of the activity and the potential risks and benefits of their involvement. Given the variety of formats collected – audio, video, images – informed consent must cover the full scope of the activity. Beyond the formal process of informed consent, make sure that the people, group, or community being observed know about the study and its aims.\nWhether conducting participant or non-participant observation, creating a comfortable and calm atmosphere is crucial to avoid discomfort and encourage spontaneity. Show interest, friendliness, and respect for all contributions, and maintain a curious and open-minded attitude, even when discussions are lengthy or opinions differ from your own. Finally, take notes on your observations or make audiovisual records according to your study’s requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip for long-term observations\n\n\n\nIn prolonged observations, it is strongly recommended to supplement the notes of the research activities with field diaries.\n\n\n\nPotential challenges in a qualitative observation\nThere are situations that could take place during a qualitative interview that you should be prepared for. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrust on the part of the participants\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the presence of observers inherently alters the participants’ daily routine, it can also lead to increased distrust among some individuals. Provide a detailed introduction, clearly explaining the purpose of your visit and the activities involved. Reassure participants that they are not being evaluated or judged. Use electronic devices like a computer or cell phone to record key ideas, which may make participants feel less directly observed. If the observation was planned as non-participant, consider engaging in the activities to create a more comfortable environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficulty in documenting all data\n\n\n\n\n\nBalancing observation with participation can make it challenging to document all relevant information that arises during the activity. Prioritize information that is most relevant to your research. Focus on the research objectives and follow the observation guide to maintain attention on key aspects. Take quick notes during the observation, using keywords or key concepts to capture essential details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectivity vs. subjectivity\n\n\n\n\n\nSince observation is a subjective technique, it is crucial to differentiate between your interpretations and the descriptive elements of the environment. Write your diary or field note in three stages: Describe the environment and the participants’ interactions. Detail your own participation in the space. Record reflections and interpretations that emerge from the observation. Remember that it is essential to keep a distance from the observation activities. You should participate in the spaces while maintaining an objective view from a distance.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerating agreement on assigned values\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing quantitative scales in observations can be challenging, as it requires consensus on what each observer should record in each response box. Establish clear observation agreements or use standardized rating rubrics to ensure consistency across observers. Start with an unstructured observation to identify any biases or concerns, then proceed to a structured observation based on those insights. When assigning values on a scale, provide a rationale in additional comments to clarify why a particular category was selected.",

This distance can lead to a disconnect between the observer and the participants’ reality, which may limit the depth of reflections and interpretations. Despite these limitations, virtual observations can provide valuable insights, particularly in evaluating specific aspects of social programs. For instance, quantitative data can be collected by observing recorded class sessions, contributing to assessments of program impact.\nVirtual observations can also serve as an alternative when constraints arise in the following resources:\n\nTime: When scheduling conflicts or time zone differences make in-person observations impractical.\nBudget: When financial limitations restrict travel and accommodation expenses.\nAccessibility: When physical access to the observation site is challenging due to geographical or logistical barriers.\nHealth and Safety: When health risks, such as during a pandemic, prevent in-person interactions.\nEthical Concerns: When the presence of an observer might influence participants’ behavior or when anonymity is crucial.\n\nBy leveraging digital tools and platforms, researchers can continue to gather valuable data while adapting to various constraints and ensuring the safety and well-being of both observers and participants.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Considerations and challenges in virtual observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDescription\nPossible solutions\n\n\n\n\nVolume of observations\nConducting around 500 observations posed significant logistical challenges, requiring large teams and extensive resources.\nUse audiovisual recordings to capture information, which the designated team can then review.\n\n\nObserver profile\nIf the project’s focus on socio-emotional skills necessitates observers with specific professional expertise.\nIdentify the appropriate observer profile, both professionally and personally.

    "section": "Widgets",
    "text": "Widgets\nTo create a Twilio flow, follow these steps. First, navigate to the “Studio” section in the main navigation menu. Click on the “Create a Flow” button or the “+” icon to start creating a flow. Provide a name and an optional description for your flow. You will then be taken to the Flow Builder, where you can design your flow visually.\n\n\n\nCreate Twilio flow\n\n\nAfter the flow is created, you can drag widgets from the sidebar onto the canvas to build your flow, connecting them with connectors to define the conversation or logic flow. Customize each widget’s settings according to your requirements. In Twilio messaging, widgets are interactive elements or components that can be used to enhance the user experience and gather information from users. They provide a way to incorporate dynamic and engaging elements within the messaging flow. Widgets are typically used to collect user input, display options, or present interactive content.\nThe widget library is on the right side of the Flow Builder. Here you can see the four main categories:\n\nFlow control: These widgets allow you to implement conditional logic and control the flow of a conversation or process, enabling dynamic decision-making based on specific conditions or user inputs.\nVoice: These widgets facilitate the implementation of voice-based interactions, enabling functionalities such as making and receiving phone calls, playing audio prompts, gathering user input through speech recognition, and routing calls to different destinations based on conditions or logic.\nMessaging: These widgets enable the implementation of interactive messaging experiences, allowing functionalities like sending and receiving SMS, WhatsApp, and multimedia messages (MMS), collecting user input, displaying options, and handling conversations in a dynamic and engaging manner.\nTools and execute code: These widgets provide developers with tools to perform actions like making API requests, executing JavaScript code, accessing external resources, and integrating custom logic into their Twilio applications, allowing for enhanced customization and flexibility in the application’s behavior.\nConnect other products: These widgets facilitate seamless integration with external services and products, enabling developers to incorporate functionalities from other platforms, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, databases, or third-party APIs, into their Twilio applications, expanding the capabilities and possibilities of their communication workflows.\n\n\n\n\nTwilio Flow Builder Interface\n\n\n\nTrigger Widget\nIn Twilio Studio, the “Trigger” widget is a crucial component with specific functionality. The Trigger widget initiates the execution of a Twilio Studio flow. This is how it works:\n\nEntry Point: The Trigger widget serves as the entry point of your Studio flow. When an event or condition occurs that should start the flow, the Trigger widget is activated.\nEvent-Based Start: The Trigger widget is often configured to start the flow based on a specific event, such as an incoming call, message, or any other trigger you define.\nConnectivity to External Systems: The Trigger widget can also be connected to external systems or services using Twilio Functions or other Twilio products. For example, you might use a Trigger to initiate a flow when receiving a webhook.\nCustom Triggers: Additionally, you can use custom triggers to initiate a flow. This involves setting up conditions within your application or system that, when met, send a request to Twilio to trigger the associated Studio flow.\nHandling Incoming Communication: Common use cases involve using the Trigger widget to handle incoming communication, such as an incoming call or message, and then guiding the flow through subsequent widgets to provide responses or perform specific actions.\n\n\n\n\nTrigger Widget Example\n\n\n\n\nMessaging Widgets\nThere are two widgets in this section: the “Send Message” and “Send and Wait for Reply” widgets. These are used for displaying content in the survey.\n\nSend Message widget: This feature allows you to send outbound messages to recipients using various channels, including SMS, WhatsApp, or other messaging services. By specifying the content, it enables efficient and personalized communication with users. The Send Message widget in Twilio establishes a unidirectional connection, where the system sends a message to a recipient without waiting for or expecting a response. It is primarily used for one-way notifications, alerts, or information dissemination.\n\n\n\n\nSend Message Widget Example\n\n\n\nSend and Wait for Reply widget: This feature allows you to send a message to a recipient and pause the flow, waiting for their response. You can specify the message content, and the flow will wait for the recipient to reply before proceeding. This facilitates interactive and dynamic conversations involving back-and-forth communication with users. The Send and Wait for Reply widget establishes a bidirectional connection, enabling interactive conversations and allowing for dynamic communication between the system and the user.\n\n\n\n\nSend and Wait Widget Example\n\n\nIn summary, the key distinction lies in the type of connection established by these widgets. The Send Message widget operates with a unidirectional connection for one-way messaging, while the Send and Wait for Reply widget establishes a bidirectional connection to enable interactive conversations by awaiting and processing user responses.\n\n\nFlow Control Widgets\nThere are three widgets in this section: the “Split Based On,” “Set Variable,” and “Run Subflow” widgets. These widgets allow you to implement conditional logic and control the flow of a conversation or process, enabling dynamic decision-making based on specific conditions or user inputs.\n\nSplit Based On: This widget enables you to dynamically split the flow of your application based on specific conditions or logic. It allows you to define multiple paths or branches within your flow, each with its own set of conditions and actions. When a message or event reaches the Split Based On widget, you can configure it to evaluate certain criteria, such as user input, variables, or data from previous steps in the flow. Based on the evaluation, the widget routes the flow to the appropriate branch that matches the condition. This widget is useful for implementing decision-making logic within your application. It enables you to create different paths or outcomes based on specific conditions, providing a way to customize the user experience, handle different scenarios, and route conversations accordingly. In this example, the system evaluates if the participant replied with a Yes or a No.\n\n\n\n\nSplit Based On Widget Example\n\n\n\nSet Variable: This widget enables the creation and assignment of variables within an application’s flow. By defining variable names and assigning values to them, developers can store and manipulate data throughout the conversation or process. These values can be constants, dynamic inputs from users or system data, or the result of calculations. The variables can then be referenced and utilized in subsequent steps of the flow, allowing for personalized and dynamic interactions. The Set Variable widget empowers developers to manage and track information, perform calculations, and make conditional decisions based on the stored values, enhancing the flexibility and customization of Twilio applications. In this case, you create a dummy variable that will take a value of 1 when the user replies with a Yes.\n\n\n\n\nSet Variable Widget Example\n\n\n\nRun Subflow: This widget enables the execution of separate and reusable subflows within the main flow of an application. By invoking a specific subflow and providing necessary input parameters, developers can modularize complex logic or functionality. This promotes code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and enhances flow organization. Upon executing the subflow, the control returns to the main flow, allowing for seamless integration and continuation of the application’s logic. The Run Subflow widget empowers developers to create more efficient and manageable Twilio applications by encapsulating and invoking reusable subflows as needed. In this case, you tell Twilio to send a user to a different flow (or survey) based on their answer.\n\n\n\n\nRun Subflow Widget Example\n\n\nIn summary, the Split Based On widget enables branching based on conditions, the Set Variable widget transitions linearly with variable assignments, and the Run Subflow widget transitions back to the main flow after executing the separate subflow. You can see how they look in the following image.\n\n\nFunction Widgets\n\nRun Function widget: This feature provides a powerful capability to execute custom code or serverless functions within your Twilio application. By utilizing this widget, you can perform specific actions, implement custom logic, and seamlessly integrate external functionality into your Twilio Studio flow. Whether you need to make API calls, perform calculations, access external resources, or implement complex business logic, the “Run Function” widget enhances the capabilities of your Twilio application, allowing you to extend its functionality and customize its behavior according to your unique requirements. This example uses a function that waits a few seconds between questions or messages. This is useful when you want to make the survey feel more natural and have a more human-like interaction with the user.\n\n\n\n\nRun Function Widget Example",

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nThere are three widgets in this section: the “Run Function,” “Make HTTP Request,” and “Add TwiML Redirect” widgets. This section focuses only on the “Run Function” widget.\nTo leverage functions in Twilio, you can write them in JavaScript or any supported language of your choice. These functions can be triggered within a Twilio Studio flow using either the “HTTP Request” or “Run Function” widgets. By incorporating the “Run Function” widget, you can execute custom code or serverless functions, enabling you to perform specific actions and implement customized logic tailored to your Twilio application. This integration of functions seamlessly merges external functionality, enhancing the capabilities of your Twilio Studio flow and empowering you to create dynamic and powerful communication experiences.\n\nWait Function\nThe Wait function creates a pause in the flow execution, allowing for a more natural experience for the respondent. By introducing pauses between questions or messages, the Wait function gives respondents sufficient time to read and comprehend lengthy text in the survey. This helps to ensure a smooth and user-friendly survey interaction, allowing respondents to fully engage with the content and provide thoughtful responses. Let’s create this function in Twilio.\n\nNavigate to Functions and Assets: Go to the Twilio Console and locate the “Functions and Assets” section.\nAccess the Services Tab: Within “Functions and Assets,” click on the “Services” tab to manage your services.\n\n\n\n\nAccess the Services Tab\n\n\n\nCreate a Service: Click on the option to create a service. Name this service “functions.”\n\n\n\n\nCreate Service\n\n\n\nCreate a Function: Inside the “functions” service, select the option to create a function.\nName the Function: When prompted to name the function, enter “wait.”\n\n\n\n\nName the Function\n\n\n\nPaste the Code: Within the “wait” function, paste the following lines of code.\n\nexports.handler = function(context, event, callback) {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    return callback(null, null);\n  }, 1000);\n};\n\nSave the Function: Save the function after pasting the code to preserve your changes.\nDependencies: Click on the dependency configuration and select the “Node.js v16” option.\nDeploy the Service: After the function is saved, deploy the entire service to make the changes effective.\n\nBy following these steps, you’ll successfully create a Wait function inside the Twilio platform.\n\n\nGSheet Publish Function\nThe GSheet Publish function in Twilio facilitates the transmission of participant responses to a Google Sheet, enabling you to track and manage the collected data. By utilizing this function, the responses provided by participants are seamlessly sent to a designated Google Sheet, ensuring easy access to the data for analysis and tracking purposes. This functionality streamlines the process of gathering and organizing responses, allowing you to efficiently monitor and manage the collected information within a familiar spreadsheet format.\nThis function is covered in detail in the WhatsApp Survey Deploy guide.\n\n\nEncrypt Function\nThe Encrypt function is designed to encrypt variables, ensuring that sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), remains secure when data is stored or published. By encrypting the variables, the values are transformed into a secure format, protecting them from unauthorized access or exposure. This functionality is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of user data within the server. The Encrypt function provides a robust layer of security to prevent the public disclosure of sensitive data.\nThis function is covered in detail in the WhatsApp and Data Security guide.",

A thorough bench test involves systematically reviewing each question while considering these key aspects:\n\nSurvey Flow: Does the survey run from start to finish in all scenarios?\nResponse Options: Are all possible answers covered, including “don’t know” and “refuse”?\nNumeric Constraints: Are appropriate limits set for numeric inputs?\nSkip Logic: Does the branching logic work correctly? Are questions showing or hiding as intended?\nEnumerator Guidance: Are hints provided where needed to ensure consistent question delivery?\n\nThe technical review of SurveyCTO xlsform code should focus on:\n\nChoice Lists: Check for duplicate or overlapping options\nVariable Names: Ensure they are under 32 characters—shorter in repeat groups\nBest Practices: Verify compliance with SurveyCTO standards—rosters, audits, etc.",

    "text": "How to Bench Test\nEffective bench testing requires input from multiple team members and should be an ongoing process throughout survey development.\n\nIn the Office\nKey resources for office testing include:\n\nField managers\nResearch assistants\nProject managers\nAvailable enumerators\nFresh eyes from other teams\n\nUsing SurveyCTO’s “Test” feature allows you to:\n\nSimulate different scenarios without submitting data\nSave progress for various respondent profiles\nReview constraints and skip logic in real-time\nSwitch between testing and editing\n\n\n\nDuring Enumerator Training\nEnumerator training provides a crucial opportunity for final survey validation:\n\nQuality Feedback: Enumerators can identify:\n\nUnclear wording\nMissing answer options\nConstraint issues\nSkip logic problems\n\nRole-Playing Benefits:\n\nCreates realistic testing scenarios\nGenerates dummy data for analysis\nHelps standardize question delivery\nFamiliarizes enumerators with the survey flow\n\n\nAs enumerators inevitably find issues and bugs within the survey, be sure to write these down and track all changes. One solution is to include the “comments” field type in SurveyCTO. SurveyCTO forms allow for a “comments” field type, where enumerators can add comments to survey questions while administering a survey. In order to use this, include a “comments” field type, and name the variable. See the example below:\n\n\n\nComments field type\n\n\nThis field type creates an option for every question in the survey where enumerators can comment on the question. This can include survey logic issues, missing options, confusing wording, or any other issues an enumerator has with a question. It appears next to other options as a pencil while administering the survey:\n \nThe system exports comments as media files, similar to audio audits or images. The files appear in a directory under the variable name you assigned to the comments field type. For this example, they would appear under the variable q_comments. IPA’s Data Management System includes the command -ipacheckcomment-, which compiles these files into a summary sheet in the outputs. There is also a user-written Stata command named -remedia- that helps rename and move media files.\nThis feature helps catch issues while the survey is being administered to quickly change them during data collection. Once you have dummy data from enumerator training or other types of bench testing, it is important to run your entire data flow to test your checks and inspect the format of your data before the survey enters the field.\nThis feature helps catch issues while enumerators administer the survey to change them during data collection. After you have dummy data from enumerator training or other bench testing, run your entire data flow. Test your checks and inspect the format of your data before the survey enters the field.\nThis feature helps catch issues while enumerators administer the survey to change them during data collection.

Start with the 3_checks/1_inputs folder, which contains these files:\n\nhfc_inputs.xlsm - input Excel file; inside you’ll find a convenient form for configuring some of the HFC commands.\ncorrections.xlsm - replacement Excel file; it is a running list of edits/corrections based on HFC outputs; these replacements can be automatically added to your workflow using ipacheckcorrections.\nspecifyrecode.xlsm - other specify input Excel file; it is a running list instruction for recoding other specify values; these instructions will be automatically added to your workflow using ipacheckspecifyrecode.\n\nNow go back to the main folders.\n\n0_master.do - master dofile; it runs all other do-files 2_dofiles folder\n\nNow navigate to 2_dofiles.\n\n1_globals.do - globals do-file; it contains globals for setting up the Data Management System.\n3_prepsurvey.do - data preparation do-file; it contains sample code for preparing the raw Survey data for High-Frequency Checks (HFCs).\n4_checksurvey.do - HFC do-file; it contains code for running checks on the Survey dataset.\n5_prepbc.do - data preparation do-file; it contains sample code for preparing the raw Back Check data for Back Check Comparison (HFCs).\n6_checkbc.do - Back Check do-file; it contains code for running checks on the back check dataset as well as running the back check comparison.\n\n\n\nSection 2: Configure Main Inputs\nThis section walks you through setting up your DMS configuration.\n\nOpen the Globals File\nNavigate to the 2_dofiles folder and open the 1_globals.do file. This file configures the High-Frequency Checks. Each section includes descriptions for each global variable. Some globals contain default values that you may need to modify.\nConfigure the following sections:\n\n\nRun/Turn Off Specific Checks\nSet the value “1” for each check you want to run. The value “1” tells Stata to run and configure that check. To turn off a specific check, change the corresponding global value to 0. This exercise runs almost all available checks, so activate all checks as shown in the code below.\n\n**# Run/Turn Off Specific Checks\n*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n\n    * NB: Edit this section: Change the value to 0 to turn off specific checks\n\n    gl run_corrections      1   //  Apply corrections\n    gl run_specifyrecode    1   //  Recode other specify\n    gl run_version      1   //  Check for outdated survey form versions\n    gl run_ids      1   //  Check Survey ID for duplicates\n    gl run_dups     1   //  Check other Survey variables for duplicates\n    gl run_missing      1   //  Check variable missingness\n    gl run_outlier      1   //  Check numeric variables for outliers\n        gl run_constraints  1   //  Check numeric variables for constraint violations\n    gl run_logic        1   //  Check variables for logical violations\n    gl run_specify      1   //  Check for other specify values\n    gl run_comments     1   //  Collate and output field comments\n    gl run_textaudit    1   //  Check Survey duration using text audit data\n    gl run_timeuse      1   //  Check active survey hours using text audit data\n    gl run_surveydb     1   //  Create survey Dashboard\n    gl run_enumdb       1   //  Create enumerator Dashboard\n    gl run_tracksurvey  1   //  Report on survey progress\n    gl run_trackbc      0   //  Report on Back check progress\n    gl run_bc       1   //  Back Check comparison\n\n\nInput Files\nThis section specifies file paths for the hfc_inputs, corrections, and recode specify input files. The default values are correct for this exercise, so no changes are needed.\n\n\nDatasets\nThis section specifies file paths and filenames for input datasets required by various commands, including:\n\nRaw, prepped and de-duplicated survey datasets\nBack check datasets\nCollated field comments and text audit datasets\n\nThe default values for rawsurvey, preppedsurvey, checkedsurvey, rawbc, preppedbc and checkedbc are correct for this exercise.\nYou will be configuring the ipatracksurveys command using a master dataset which has information for each target respondent. Navigate to the 4_data/2_survey folder and examine the household_preloads.xlsx file. This file will be used as the master dataset when comparing the surveys submitted to the individuals to be interviewed. After viewing this file, go back to the 1_globals.do file and indicate the value \"${cwd}/4_data/2_survey/household_preloads.xlsx\" for the global mastersurvey. Note that the master data can also be a dta or csv file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ntrackingsurvey is an alternative to mastersurvey. However, trackingsurvey expects a dataset than contains targets for specified groups. eg. community, district, treatment_status. It is more suitable for census-type surveys when we don’t have a pre-selected list of respondents. Explore the dataset respondent_targets.xlsx in 4_data/2_survey to see an example of a trackingsurvey dataset.\n\n\nIgnore the masterbc & trackingbc globals for now. When will configure those when reviewing the back check sections.\nNow configure the commentsdata and textauditdata global by yourself. Note that these files currently do not exist and will be created when you run your DMS. It is recommended to set the file path for these files to \"${cwd}/4_data/2_survey\". Also, ensure to use file names that will be easier to identify later on.\nCompare your do-file to the code below and make any adjustments if necessary.\n\n* Datasets\n*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n    * NB: Edit this section: Change filenames if necessary\n\n    gl rawsurvey            \"${cwd}/4_data/2_survey/household_survey.dta\"\n    gl preppedsurvey        \"${cwd}/4_data/2_survey/household_survey_prepped.dta\"\n    gl checkedsurvey        \"${cwd}/4_data/2_survey/household_survey_checked.dta\"\n\n    gl mastersurvey         \"${cwd}/4_data/2_survey/household_preloads.xlsx\"\n    gl trackingsurvey       \"\"\n\n    gl rawbc            \"${cwd}/4_data/3_backcheck/household_backcheck.dta\"\n    gl preppedbc            \"${cwd}/4_data/3_backcheck/household_backcheck_prepped.dta\"\n    gl checkedbc            \"${cwd}/4_data/3_backcheck/household_backcheck_checked.dta\"\n\n    gl masterbc             \"${cwd}/4_data/3_backcheck/household_backcheck_preloads.xlsx\"\n    gl trackingbc           \"\"\n\n    gl commentsdata         \"${cwd}/4_data/2_survey/comments_data.dta\"\n    gl textauditdata        \"${cwd}/4_data/2_survey/textaudit_data.dta\"\n\n\nSurveyCTO media folder\nThis section specifies the folder that contains the SurveyCTO generated comments and text audits files. You do not need to make changes here since the default values are correct for this exercise.\n\n\nOutput Date Folder\nThis section creates a subfolder in 3_checks/2_outputs for the current date that the DMS is running. This section should never be edited.\n\n\nOutput files\nThis section specifies the output files from the various checks. The output files include the duplicates, corrections, recode specify, hfc, text audit, timeuse, survey dashboard, enumerator dashboard and survey tracking outputs. You do not need to make changes here since the default values are correct for this exercise.\n\n\nAdmin variables\nThis section specifies the global administrative variables for the DMS. These are variables that are used in various sections of the DMS. These include the key, survey id, enumerator, date, team, starttime, duration, form version, field comments, text audit, consent and outcome variables as well as variables to keep in all checks. The default variables specified for some of the globals are correct for this check, however, we need to configure the remaining additional checks as follows.\n* Admin variables\n*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n    * NB: Edit this section: Change variable names if necessary.\n\n    * Required Variables:\n\n    gl key              \"key\"\n    gl id               \"hhid\"\n    gl enum             \"a_enum_id\"\n    gl enumteam             \"a_team_id\"\n    gl bcer             \"a_bcer_id\"\n    gl bcerteam         \"a_team_id\"\n    gl date             \"starttime\"\n\n    * Optional Variables:\n\n    gl team             \"a_team_name\"\n    gl starttime            \"starttime\"\n    gl duration         \"duration\"\n    gl formversion          \"formdef_version\"\n    gl fieldcomments        \"field_comments\"\n    gl textaudit            \"text_audit\"\n    gl keepvars             \"a_kg a_district\"\n    gl consent          \"c_consent\"\n    gl outcome          \"\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe survey has no outcome variable so we will leave the outcome global blank.\n\n\n\n\nResponse values\nThis section specifies values that represent specified response values in the survey. You will be making some adjustments to this section to reflect the dataset. The values for cons_vals are correct and should not be modified. However, you remember from the previous section that the survey does not include an outcome variable, therefore set the value for the outc_vals global to empty ie. \"\".\nAfter reviewing the data, we realize that the survey programming allowed the values -999, 999 and .999 as don;t know values for numeric variables and -888, 888 and .888 as “refuse to answer” values for numeric variables.\nTo account for this, modify the values of the dk_num and ref_num globals as follows:\n* Missing values\n*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n    * NB: Edit this section: Change values if necessary.\n\n    gl cons_vals            \"1\"\n    gl outc_vals            \"1\"\n    gl dk_num           \"-999 999 .999\"\n    gl dk_str           \"-999\"\n    gl ref_num          \"-888 888 .888\"\n    gl ref_str          \"-888\"\n\n\n\nSection 3: Configure additional inputs\nThe second half of 1_globals.do specify settings that are peculiar to individual checks in the DMS. Review the remaining sections carefully. Note that for many of these sections, you will not need to make any additional changes. After review, make changes to the following sections:\n\nipacheckdups: Export variable duplicates\nSet the value of the global dp_vars as \"resp_contact\" to flag duplicates in phone numbers.\n\n\nipachecksurveydb: Export Survey Dashboard\nSet the value of the global sv_by as \"a_district\" to disaggregate the survey dashboard by the values of the a_district variable.\n\n\nipatracksurvey: Export tracking sheet\nSet the values of the following globals as follows:\n* ipatracksurvey: Export tracking sheet\n*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n    gl tr_by            \"a_kg\"\n    gl tr_target            \"\"\n    gl tr_keepmaster        \"a_district\"\n    gl tr_keeptracking      \"\"\n    gl tr_keepsurvey        \"submissiondate c_consent\"\n    gl tr_summaryonly       \"\"\n    gl tr_workbooks         \"workbooks\"\n        gl tr_save                      \"\"\n        gl tr_surveyok          \"surveyok\"\nSave the 1_globals.do file.\nNavigate to the 3_checks/1_inputs folder and open the hfc_inputs.xlsm file in Excel. This is where you’ll do the additional configuration for the ipacheckoutliers, ipacheckconstraints, ipachecklogic, ipacheckspecify and enumstats for ipacheckenumdb.\nExplore the dataset 4_data/2_survey/household_survey.dta and identify the variables for the following sheets:\n\n\nother specify\nThe “other specify” sheet specifies the parent and child variables for other specify responses. Explore the household dataset and identify the parent and child variables. The parent variables are the control variables which trigger the other specify question. Note that all the child variables in this dataset include _osp in their variable names.\nUpon completion, navigate to 0_archive and open the file hfc_inputs_exercise.xlsm and compare your work with the sheet \"other specify\".\n\n\noutliers\nThe “outliers” sheet specifies the numeric variables to check for outliers. These are usually numeric variables that are not constrained or have a wide constraint range. Review the help file for ipacheckoutliers to understand what is required for by, method, multiplier, combine and the keep columns.\nUpon completion, navigate to 0_archive and open the file hfc_inputs_exercise.xlsm and compare your work with the sheet \"outliers\".\n\n\nconstraints\nThe constraints sheet specifies the numeric variables to check for constraint violations. These are usually numeric variables which you want to check for soft constraints. Review the help file for ipacheckconstraints to understand what is required for hard_min, soft_min, soft_max, hard_max and the keep columns.\nUpon completion, navigate to 0_archive and open the file hfc_inputs_exercise.xlsm and compare your work with the sheet \"constraints\".\n\n\nlogic\nThe logic sheet specifies the variables to check for logical inconsistencies in survey variables. ipachecklogic checks for logic violations using logical statements as indicated in the assert column of the input sheet. Review the help file for ipachecklogic to understand what is required for assert, if_condition and the keep columns.\nThe scope of this exercise does not cover the ipachecklogic so you are free to exclude it from this exercise. You may also read the help file for ipachecklogic for examples of how to use this check.\n\n\nenumstats\nThe enumstats sheet specifies the variables and additional setup for the enumstats option of ipacheckenumdb. The variables specified are usually numeric variables for which we want to check for variations among enumerators. For instance, we may want to examine how enumerators are reporting household member counts or total household income. Review the help file for ipacheckenumdb to understand what is required for the columns min, mean, show_mean_as, median, sd, max and combine. Please note that for this section, there is no single correct or wrong answer, however, to help guide the exercise complete the enumstats sheet as follows:\n\n\n\nTable 1: enumstats sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nlabel\nmin\nmean\nshow_mean_as\nmedian\nsd\nmax\ncombine\n\n\n\n\ngpsaccuracy\nGPS Accuracy\nyes\nyes\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\nf_hhm_cnt\n(FA2) Based on the definition that I just read to you, how many members are in y\nyes\nyes\n\nyes\n\nyes\n\n\n\ni_phone_num\n(I01) How many household members own a working mobile phone?\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\nyes\n\n\n\nj_land_yn\n(J01) Does your household own any land?\n\nyes\npercentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk_own_yn\n(K01) Does your household own any livestock?\n\nyes\npercentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also include other variables that you find useful.\nSave the hfc_inputs.xlsm file\nNavigate back to 2_dofiles folder and open up the 3_prepsurvey.do file. This do-file contains sections of sample codes that may be needed to prepare your data before running the checks. These include dropping variables, destringing variables, generating a short key if needed, generating date variables from default datetime variables and dropping observations that were started before specified dates.\nReview this do-file carefully and make edits where necessary.\nThe data includes temporary variables that were added for SurveyCTO programming purposes only and therefore do not contain any useful information. Luckily these variables are prefixed by tmp_. Drop these variables by adding tmp_* to the list of variables to drop in the “drop unwanted variables” section.\nThe data also contains “calculate fields” that were imported as strings instead of numeric variables. Include *_yn* to the “destring numeric” variables sections to destring all variables that have the `_yn’ in their variable names. Explore the data and include more variables to destring.\nSave the 3_prepsurvey.do file.\n\n\n\nSection 4: Run and Review the Output\nNavigate back to the main folder and open the 0_master.do file. Before running your checks, make sure that your current working directory is the directory that contains 0_master.do file.\nComment out the section of the code that runs the import do-file, the back check prep and the back check comparison.\n**# Survey 1\n*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n    do \"2_dofiles/1_globals.do\"         // globals do-file\n    * do \"2_dofiles/2_import_wbnp_hhs_2021.do\"  // import do-file\n    do \"2_dofiles/3_prepsurvey.do\"          // prep survey do-file\n    do \"2_dofiles/4_checksurvey.do\"         // check survey do-file\n    * do \"2_dofiles/5_prepbc.do\"            // prep back check do-file\n    * do \"2_dofiles/6_checkbc.do\"           // check survey do-file\nRun the entire do file.\nAfter running the do-file, you should get the following error:\nworksheet duplicates corrections not found\nTo resolve this error, we need to set-up the correction sheet. Navigate to 3_checks\\1_inputs and open the file corrections.xlsm. Read the instructions and create 2 correction sheets on this workbook using the following information:\n\ncorrection sheet for duplicates\n\n\n\nduplicates_corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe SurveyCTO generated key variable or another type of key variable should be used as ID when resolving duplicates. Although you can use the key and hence the same sheet to resolve other duplicates, it is recommended to create a separate sheet using the Survey ID since that will facilitate communication when resolving these issues.\n\n\n\n\ncorrection sheet for other issues\n\n\n\nother_corrections\n\n\nRun the 0_master.do again. Once it runs successfully, you should have a list of output files in the date subfolder the in 3_checks/2_outputs folder. Open each file and inspect its content.\nNavigate to the 04_checks/02_outputs folder and open the various output files and answer the following questions:\n\nHow many interviews have been conducted?\nAre we missing any submissions that we planned?\nIs everyone using the latest form version?\nHow many Survey ID duplicates are there in the dataset?\nHow many variables have all missing values that shouldn’t be missing?\nHow many outliers are flagged? Do any values appear to be nonsensical? What should be done?\nDo you see any specify options that could be recoded?\nWhich 3 enumerators have the lowest survey productivity scores.\nWhich 5 enumerators have the highest “don’t know” response rate\nAre there any useful comments? What should be done?\nWhat time period during the day are the enumerators most active on the field.\n\n\n\n\nSection 5: Make Replacements & Recode Other Specify\nTry adding some corrections yourself using the instructions in corrections.xlsm that was set-up earlier. Navigate to 0_archive and open the corrections_exercise.xlsm for guidance on how to make some of the corrections.\nRe-run the DMS to effect the corrections. Review the corrections logfile in 3_checks/2_outputs to verify that the changes were effected.\nNavigate to 3_checks/2_outputs to inspect the new output files. Review the hfc_output file and include your corrections in the corrections.xlsm file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOther specify recodes cannot be done in the corrections.xlsm file and must be done in the specifyrecode.xlsm file.\n\n\nOpen the specifyrecode.xlsm file (in 3_checks/1_inputs folder). Read the Stata help file for ipacheckspecifyrecode to understand how to use the specifyrecode.xlsm file.\nNavigate to 0_archive and open the specifyrecode_exercise.xlsm for guidance on how to recode other specify values.\nRe-run the DMS to effect the recodes. Review the other specify recode logfile in 3_checks/2_outputs to verify that the changes were effected.\n\n\nSection 6: Set-up back check comparison\nNavigate back to 2_dofiles folder and open up the 5_prepbc.do file. This do-file contains sections of sample codes that may be needed to prepare your back check dataset as well as running back check comparison.

The goal was to help students who were falling behind catch up with their peers.\nRandomization:\n\nUnit: 122 schools were randomized to either receive the Balsakhi intervention or serve as controls.\nStratification: Randomization was stratified by language of instruction (Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, English) and by gender composition (boys’, girls’, and co-ed schools) to ensure balance across key characteristics.\n\nImplementation:\n\nWithin treatment schools, Balsakhis (local young women trained as tutors) worked with the lowest-performing students, identified using baseline test scores.\nStrict protocols were followed to prevent contamination between treatment and control schools, including separate training and monitoring teams.\nDetailed documentation and monitoring ensured fidelity to the randomization plan.\n\nResults:\n\nThe program led to a significant improvement of 0.14 standard deviations in test scores for all students, and even larger gains for the weakest students.\nThe study demonstrated the power of cluster-level randomization and the importance of stratification for balance.\n\nReferences:\n\nBanerjee, A., Cole, S., Duflo, E., and Linden, L.

    "section": "Informed Consent",
    "text": "Informed Consent\n\nWhat is informed consent?\nInformed consent in research is the process of providing potential participants with all necessary information about a study. This allows them to make an informed decision about whether to participate. Researchers must obtain participants’ informed consent before involving them in research.\n\n\nWhy is informed consent important?\nThis requirement is founded on the principle of “respect for persons”—one of three core ethical principles governing human subjects research described in the Belmont Report. Respect for persons requires that individuals receive treatment as autonomous agents and “be given the opportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them.” It also requires that persons with diminished autonomy – such as children, prisoners, and cognitively impaired adults – receive special protections.\n\n\nWhat does informed consent look like in practice?\n“Informed consent” is simultaneously (1) a process, (2) a decision, and (3) a form or script.\n\nProcess\nThe informed consent process is a dynamic interaction wherein: - Researchers provide information, such as risks and benefits, about the study which may affect a potential subject’s willingness to participate - Researchers facilitate the potential subject’s understanding of that information by inviting them to ask questions, re-explaining anything they found confusing, etc. - Researchers emphasize and protect the voluntariness of a subject’s decision about whether to participate\nThis process should not feel like a dry, esoteric, one-sided lecture. Instead, it creates an opportunity for an engaging, honest discussion about the risks and benefits of the research with a potential participant. Enumerators need training to verify whether respondents have questions and to check for understanding of key elements. IPA encourages researchers to think innovatively about the best way to deliver the information required in an informed consent.\n\n\nDecision\nAt the end of this process—once the potential subject understands all relevant information—the subject will decide whether to participate. The decision to participate in research is not a binding agreement—a subject is always free to withdraw their consent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe decision to participate in research is not a binding agreement—a subject is always free to withdraw their consent.\n\n\n\n\nForm / Script\nThe exchange of information—between researchers and the potential subject—that occurs during the informed consent process can take place in either a written or verbal format (or both). The following approaches are most common at IPA: - An enumerator reads aloud a written form or script to the subject (face-to-face or by phone) - The research team provides a written form for the subject to read (on paper or electronically) and keep for future reference\nThe format used often depends on specific research logistics. For example, phone surveys make it impossible to provide subjects with written paper forms, so enumerators read the consent aloud by phone.\nRegardless of how researchers conduct the informed consent process, they must also decide how to document a subject’s decision. Consent may be documented in one or more of the following ways: - The subject may provide a signature (or thumbprint) - The subject may click a button or checkbox indicating their consent (e.g., if completing an online survey) - The subject may express their consent verbally; in this case, researchers must have some system for documenting the subject’s response\nIf the IRB determines the research is greater than minimal risk, subjects typically must provide a signature documenting their consent.\n\n\n\nWhat should be included in a consent form/script?\nFederal regulations require that certain key elements be included in an informed consent. The IPA IRB has developed two resources to help research teams prepare good consent forms: - A checklist of required elements (this is what IPA IRB looks for when evaluating a submitted consent form) - A template consent form (this provides a sample structure and language to cover all required elements in the checklist)\nYou do not need to use IPA IRB’s template to develop your consent, but every relevant element on the checklist must be present. Using the template is a shortcut to ensuring that all requirements in the checklist are met. If you do not wish to use the template, it is still to your benefit to check your consent against the checklist before you submit, as IPA IRB uses this checklist each time it evaluates whether a submitted consent meets the proper standards.\n\n\nAlteration or waiver of consent\nIn some circumstances, researchers may request that required elements of the consent process be waived (“alteration of consent”). In even rarer circumstances, researchers may request that the requirement to obtain subject consent be waived entirely (“waiver of consent”).\nIn either of these circumstances, all the following criteria must be met in order for the alteration or waiver to be granted by the IRB: - The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects - Researchers could not practicably carry out the research without the requested waiver or alteration - If the research involves using PII or identifiable biospecimens, researchers could not practicably carry out the research without using such PII or biospecimens in an identifiable format - The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects - Whenever appropriate, researchers will provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with additional pertinent information after participation\nThe following are examples of circumstances where researchers might request an alteration or waiver of consent: - Waiver of parental consent (most often requested for school-based research) - Studies involving deception (i.e., leaving out information or misleading subjects about some element of the study)\nResearchers must request the IRB’s permission for any alteration or waiver of consent. To do so, describe your rationale for the requested alteration or waiver in the consent section of the protocol.\n\n\nStudies involving children\nFor studies involving minors, researchers typically must seek both: - Child assent: permission from the child themselves - Parental consent: permission, given by the parent, for the child’s participation\n“Assent” is not, and cannot substitute for, consent—legitimate consent can only be given by adults.\nA child assent form/script should be written in language understandable to the child’s age group. For children age 14+, it is typically fine to use IPA IRB’s standard consent template to develop the assent. For children age &lt;14, researchers should consider how best to communicate key information to those children such that they can make an informed choice about whether to participate in the study.\n\nWaiver of child assent\nThe IRB can waive the requirement to obtain child assent if the child cannot reasonably be consulted about their participation in the research, such as young children.\n\n\nWaiver of parental consent\nThe IRB can waive the requirement to obtain parental consent only in the following circumstances: - All criteria for a waiver of consent are met (see section above); OR - Parental permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect child subjects, such as neglected or abused children, or children living on the street without family\nEven if the IRB determines that it may waive the parental consent requirement, the IRB may require additional measures to protect child subjects, such as: - Obtaining consent from school officials, such as the child’s teacher for school-based research - Sending parents an “information sheet” which provides information about the study, as well as instructions for how to withdraw their child from participation using an “opt out” procedure\n\n\n\nOther considerations\nTiming: In most cases, researchers should obtain subjects’ informed consent before each round of data collection. In some rarer cases, researchers may need to obtain consent before the intervention, even if no data collection occurs at that point. This applies when there is no baseline survey and the study intervention is the first research procedure subjects will participate in.\nLanguage: Researchers must conduct the informed consent process in a language understandable to the potential subject.\nLiteracy: Researchers should consider the literacy level of the potential subject population when designing the consent process for their study. For example, if working with a largely illiterate subject population, researchers should conduct the consent process orally—providing only a written form for subjects to read would be inappropriate.\nNo exculpatory language: No consent may include language through which the subject waives any of their legal rights, or language that releases the researchers, sponsor, or institution from liability for negligence.",

    "text": "What is a Reliance Agreement?\nA reliance agreement is a formal, written agreement between two (or more) IRBs which enables one institution engaged in research to rely on another institution’s IRB review.\nMany research studies involve collaboration between investigators from multiple institutions which each maintain their own IRB. The advantage of a reliance agreement is that, rather than having multiple IRBs conduct their own full review of a research project, a reliance allows for only one institution to conduct a full review. This streamlines the IRB process and reduces burdens on investigators. A reliance agreement documents, in writing, the responsibilities of both the relying and reviewing institutions regarding IRB review, reporting, and oversight.",

    "text": "When is a Reliance Agreement Needed?\nFor every study IPA is engaged in, IPA IRB must do one of the following:\n\nIPA IRB conducts its own review of the project\nIPA IRB sets up a “reliance agreement” to formally cede oversight of the project to another institution’s IRB.\n\nThese are the only two options. If you do not wish to submit your project to IPA IRB, it will be necessary to set up a reliance agreement with another IRB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kinds of institutions can IPA enter reliance agreements with?\n\n\n\n\n\nIPA IRB can only enter reliance agreements with institutions that have a Federalwide Assurance (FWA). An FWA is a document held by an institution which signals that the institution has made a formal commitment to follow US federal regulations for the protection of human subjects. Most US-based university IRBs have FWAs. It is rarer for a local IRB to have an FWA, but some do. You can check whether an institution has an FWA here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I have another IRB rely on IPA IRB instead?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes! You may wish for IPA IRB to review the project and to have another institution (e.g., the PI’s university) rely on IPA IRB’s review. In some cases, a donor, partner organization, or PI’s university may even require that IPA IRB conducts its own review of the study. (As of 2024, J-PAL requires that IPA projects receiving J-PAL funding be reviewed by IPA IRB - or HML IRB.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about local IRB?\n\n\n\n\n\nIPA IRB also requires that all projects be reviewed by a local IRB in the country where research is taking place (if such an IRB exists) before human subjects activities begin.",

Once the other IRB has approved the project, send an email to humansubjects@poverty-action.org with:\n\nA completed Reliance Agreement Assessment Worksheet ([link to download from IPA IRB webpage])\nThe approval letter and all approved materials (protocol, consents, surveys, etc.) from the reviewing IRB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does IPA IRB have to review project materials if it is ceding oversight of the project?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to assess whether we are willing to cede review of any given project, an initial limited review of the project must be done. This is necessary as there are certain kinds of projects (e.g., those involving significant risks or very vulnerable populations) that IPA IRB may be less comfortable ceding to another IRB. We also must make sure that the other IRB to whom we are ceding will do the kind of thorough oversight IPA IRB expects and would do itself. Once a reliance is established, IPA IRB then cedes review/trusts that the other IRB will provide adequate oversight of the project from that point forward (potentially for years, depending on the length of the project) - so it is only initially that a team must go through “review” with IPA IRB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like another IRB to rely on IPA’s review…\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk the other IRB if they are willing to rely on IPA IRB’s review. Then, send an email to humansubjects@poverty-action.org with:\n\nA completed Reliance Agreement Assessment Worksheet ([link to download from IPA IRB webpage])\nIf not done already, prepare and submit an IRB application for your project for IPA IRB review.\n\n\n\n\nIf IPA IRB will cede oversight another IRB, there is a $500 fee. This can be either charged to a grant or invoiced. If another IRB will rely on IPA IRB’s review, there is no fee for the reliance agreement. However, regular IPA IRB review fees apply (for your initial application and any subsequent amendments, renewals, etc.).",

To create a new branch, use:\ngit checkout -b new-branch-name\nThis checks out a new branch called new-branch-name. To switch back to the main branch, use:\ngit checkout main\nTo checkout a branch from the remote repository, use:\ngit fetch origin\ngit checkout --track origin/remote-branch-name\nTo push a branch to the remote repository, use:\ngit push origin new-branch-name\nTo delete a branch, use:\ngit branch -d new-branch-name\nList all local branches:\ngit branch --list\n\n\ngit add\nAdd files that have changed and are ready to be committed to the staging area. To add a file, file_name.md, use:\ngit add file_name.md\n\n\ngit commit\nCommit changes to the checked out branch.\nGood commit messages follow the following format:\ngit commit -m \"&lt;type&gt;: &lt;description&gt;\"\nTo commit changes with a message, use:\ngit commit -m \"feat: adding new feature to the codebase\"\n\n\ngit push\nSend changes to the remote repository. To push any commits to remote use the following:\ngit push origin new-branch-name\nIf you are pushing a new branch to the remote repository, use:\ngit push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name\nConsider adding the Conventional Commits extension to your VS Code to help you write good commit messages.",

You would have to import it before you can use it.\n\nSystem Datasets\nStata comes with pre-loaded datasets that you can use to play around to learn new things on. You can see all of the available datasets by going to “File &gt; Example datasets…” or typing help dta_examples. From here you can click the “use” or “describe” buttons to load the dataset and describe them.\nIf you already know the name of the dataset you want to use, you simply need to type sysuse auto.dta for the auto dataset for example to use the data.\n\n\nCreating a dataset in Stata from scratch\nIn Stata, you can create a dataset from scratch. This can be helpful if you want to test some code, learn or check how something works. When working in a clear Stata session, you can use set obs n where n is an integer, to create that many observations in the dataset.

    "section": "Numerical formats",
    "text": "Numerical formats\nIt’s easy to forget that Stata code is operating a computer with very different rules for counting and numbers than we have in the real world. Ado (the language of .do files) allows for a high-level abstraction, where the programmer does not have to explicitly command the computer to do low-level tasks like allocating memory for data, ordering tasks, or defining how the computer should round values that can’t be precisely displayed in binary. This is rarely important, but there are a few cases where these processes, like precision of stored data, is highly relevant for statistical tasks and may need to be specified. The most relevant cases are: - IDs should be stored as string variables or have less than 8 digits if the storage type of the variable is a float - Asserts should only compare similar storage types. - All values in stata (e.g. 1 or `r(N)') are treated as doubles - Merges that do not match IDs across datasets and display bugs (e.g. 1.0000000784732907 in Excel) can be due to the storage type of the variables or values\n\nStata’s process\nVariables in Stata have storage formats and display formats. Storage formats describe how Stata is storing the variable in the computer memory – what the data are – and display formats describes the default way that the information is presented to a user. Type help format in Stata to get more information on how variables or values are displayed.\nStata has five storage formats for numerical variables that take up different amount of memory. These formats store information to a certain degree of accuracy before rounding. The first three types (byte, int, and long) in the table below can only be used for integers. float and double are the standard type. There is a trade-off for increased precision. More precise storage formats take up more memory. This will make the file larger and slow down Stata’s processes when the data are being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nMaximum digits of accuracy\nBytes of memory for a single value\n\n\n\n\nbyte\n2\n1\n\n\nint\n4\n2\n\n\nlong\n9\n4\n\n\nfloat\n7\n4\n\n\ndouble\n16\n8\n\n\n\nThis is extremely relevant when exact equivalence matters. Stata will always conduct functions in double precision (at about 16 digits of precision). Imagine that you are comparing a variable x and a number .1. Stata defaults to generating variables as floats to conserve memory. To process a calculation, Stata will transform the float x into a double and compare that value to the .1 rounded to a double. This causes results that we may not expect for numbers, like .1, that aren’t stored exactly in binary:\n. set obs 1\n. gen x = .1\n. assert x == .1\n  assertion is false\n  r(9);\n. di \"`=float(.1)'\"\n  .1000000014901161\n. di \"`=.1'\"\n  .1\nStata is not making a mistake here. This is the result of .1 not having an exact value in binary (base 2 v. base 10). Since Stata does all calculations in double precision, the rounded value of .1 is different at float precision than double precision. The code that follows shows a few ways to compare these values exactly.\n. ds x, d\n\n              storage   display    value\nvariable name   type    format     label      variable label\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nx               float   %9.0g\n\n. assert x == float(.1) // Force Stata to round double(.1) to float(.1)\n\n// force Stata to display the first and only value of x in a double format\n. assert `: di x[1]' == .1\n\n. gen double y = .1 // generate a new variable at double precision\n. assert y == .1\nThis would not be a problem for a value that can be stored exactly such as 1.\nAlthough this seems very abstract and of limited relevance, this will cause problems in the following cases that are often encountered by IPA projects: - IDs have different storage types (one is a float and one is a double for example) in a merge. Stata will not prevent you from making that merge, but will not be able to match the IDs that the programmer intended to be the same. - Numeric IDs will no longer be unique when they have more digits than their storage type can hold (16 for doubles). No numeric IDs will be unique if they have more than 17 digits, especially if the last digits are changing for individuals that should be unique. It’s best to store IDs as strings or keep ID values at the minimum length needed. - asserts that compare a scalar (r(mean)) to a variable stored as a float may not be accurate. This can be corrected by using functions like inrange() or float() as part of the assert.\n\n\nDataset Size & Memory Usage\nThere are a number of concrete ways to avoid this, as well as a lot written on how this affects computation. Memory conservation is generally not relevant for statistical programming with small N survey data that we normally work with at IPA. But this can be the relevant in large datasets where using memory on extraneous digits will slow basic computations substantively. Administrative data with observations in the hundreds of thousands to millions is an example of this that is relevant for many IPA projects.\nIt’s generally good practice to reduce the size of files using compress or by generating values in the smallest format such as gen byte dummy = (q1 == \"Yes\"), especially when the data are larger or if you are performing commands that are computationally intensive for Stata (various regressions, reshaping, etc.).\nIf you are interested in more details, Stata Corp’s blog has a few good articles on numerical precision and why this happens in computing, as well as the specific digits that float precision loses values.",

This command outputs an excel file that is a codebook of your final data including variable names, labels, types, values and value labels. Check that variables are labeled and take on a range of values that make sense.\nAnother helpful command in quality control is assert. You should include many asserts throughout your do files in order to check that your assumptions while cleaning hold. This is especially important if you are going to be collecting more data later.\nFinally, you can use the checklist in this folder to perform checks on your dataset. (To open, click on the link for the checklist and then click “view raw” to download.)\n\nChecking for Consistency Across Datasets\nOnce you have a grasp on the overall organization of a dataset — including the variable names, labels, and formats, as well as the number of observations — it’s time to dive into the relationships among variables and the distribution of values within each variable. Here, you want to check that things make sense. Can someone who said they don’t have a business really be bringing in $1 million in profits each week? Unlikely. Well-programmed surveys should minimize the need for these tests, although they are still good to implement as a check on the quality of the programming.",

    "section": "Relative references",
    "text": "Relative references\nIt is important to ensure that code can be run on multiple computers, and that code will not require hours of repair if a folder is renamed. To do this, we use relative references for file paths. The principle behind this is simple: any time a file (data, log file, another piece of code, etc.) is references in the script, the code only specifies the name of the file and some shorthand for the filepath. This shorthand will vary depending on the software used and the preferences of the analyst. In Stata, this is generally a global macro. Scripts that modify data should avoid calling any absolute file paths to ensure that any script is as flexible as possible to changes in the file path.\nFor example, if I am loading data from “C:/My Documents/My Project Folder/data.dta”, I could type use \"${relative_reference}/data.dta\" if I had defined a global called relative_reference that contained C:/My Documents/My Project Folder. In this example, I would have defined that global to save the file path somewhere earlier in the script. One thing to note is that this global uses the entire file path. A relative reference such as ${directory}/My Project Folder/data.dta introduces more possibility for error by including an absolute name of a folder. Full file paths used in the project should preferable be saved as globals or called using macro extended functions.\nThere are multiple ways to make relative references including local and global macros, setting working directories, or user written commands in Stata such as fastcd. We suggest defining global macros in the master do file or a specific global.do do file so that file paths are set in one location and are able to be called at any point during the dataflow.\n\nSetting Relative References in Stata\nTo define relative references, do files can define a global for a particular path and then use the macro name throughout to refer to the set path.\n*Set directory path\nglobal path \"C:/My Documents/My Project Folder\"\n\n*Set folder directories\nglobal data \"${path}/01_data\"\nglobal dos  \"${path}/02_do\"\nThen, whenever we call a particular file, we include the correct file path:\n*Run cleaning do file\ndo \"${dos}/clean.do\"\n\n*Use clean data:\nuse \"${data}/clean.dta\"\nNote that this names the directory where all project files are stored as the first global. After that it names relative references for each folder that contains files used by the do file using the global that contains the location of the project folder. This two-step process makes it easier to modify the do file for multiple users. Generally, the only folder that will be unique between users is the file path before the project folder (e.g. C:\\Users\\[username] is a common prefix that will change based on the username on Windows machines).\n\n\nWorking Default References\nWhat if someone new uses the project that you don’t know their username? Often, it may not be possible to match a system variables stored by Stata to a unique identify a user. There are multiple solutions to this problem. Some master do files will start with a local user command that defines who the user is and sets relative references using a conditional:\n*Define user\nloc user Me\n\n*Set project folder directory\nif \"`user`\" == \"Me\" {\n    global directory \"C:/My Documents/My Project Folder/\"\"\n}\nHowever, this requires manual management in the do file any time a new user is added to a project. To create a general case, the do file can take advantage of how Stata defines a project. When Stata is opened, State defaults to assigning a working directory by first, the location of the file being opened by Stata and second, the homepath in the profile.do file.\nWe suggest using `c(pwd)’ as a stand-in for file location and assume the user had opened the master do file: If you add this as an else at the end of the if \"`user'\"== conditionals, then there is a good chance the do file will run even if you haven’t made a specific local for the user.\n*Set default directory\nelse {\n    global directory = subinstr(\"`c(pwd)'\", \"\\\", \"/\" ,.)\n    global directory = subinstr(\"`cdloc'\", \"/02_do\", \"\", .)\n}\nThis will not work if the instance of Stata is opened from a file in a different directory than the do file that contains the code shown above. Text editors such as Atom and Sublime preserve the same instance of Stata. This code will be more likely to cause an error if the user does not use the do file editor or opens do files from the command line with doedit.",

    "text": "Useful Stata commands\nBelow we have listed some frequently overlooked commands that we enjoy using. They will make your life a lot easier if you know about them. We provide a quick summary of what the commands do and where they can be used.\nWhere we appropriate, there is a page dedicated to specific commands that provides more examples of our common uses tips and tricks, and potential concerns to be aware of when using these particular command. For full documentation simply type help [commandname] in Stata to read all about available options and examples for usage.\n\nfillin\nThis is a simple to use, but yet powerful command. Frequently in cleaning data sets, you will have an unbalanced panel, i.e. you are missing an observation for one person for some time periods. For example, imagine you have a dataset of your sample that is supposed to have one observation for each survey round such as the baseline and two endlines. However, as is common, some people were not found in the endline surveys and thus there is no observation for them at that endline. You can use this command to create all of the pairwise combinations of values of two variables i.e. you would have every survey round observation for every person.\nFrequently in cleaning data sets, you will have an unbalanced panel, i.e. you are missing an observation for one person for some time periods. For example, imagine you have a dataset of your sample that is supposed to have one observation for each survey round such as the baseline and two endlines. However, as is common, some people were not found in the endline surveys and thus there is no observation for them at that endline. See the example data below where you can see person 1 is missing an observation at endline 2.\n\n\n\nID\nSurvey_Round\nGender\n\n\n\n\n1\nbaseline\nFemale\n\n\n1\nendline1\nFemale\n\n\n2\nbaseline\nMale\n\n\n2\nendline1\nMale\n\n\n2\nendline2\nMale\n\n\n\nWe can use fillin ID Survey_Round to get the following\n\n\n\nID\nSurvey_Round\nGender\n_fillin\n\n\n\n\n1\nbaseline\nFemale\n0\n\n\n1\nendline1\nFemale\n0\n\n\n1\nendline2\n.\n1\n\n\n2\nbaseline\nMale\n0\n\n\n2\nendline1\nMale\n0\n\n\n2\nendline2\nMale\n0\n\n\n\nA couple things to note: 1. This command automatically creates an indicator variable called \\_fillin that keeps track of observations that were created from the command 2. Variables not specified in the fillin are filled in with a missing value. So after you run fillin you will need to go back and replace observations as you see appropriate. For example, for typically constant variables such as gender you could replace this new missing value to match the one above it.\nsort ID Survey_Round\nreplace Gender = Gender[_n-1] if ID == ID[_n-1] & _fillin == 1\n\n\nlabeldup\nlabeldup is a user-written command that compares value labels which have duplicate contents. For example, if in your dataset the variable q1 has a value label named q1_label with 0 \"No\" 1 \"Yes\" and the variable q2 has the same value label (the SurveyCTO standard). By using labeldup, select, the q1 and q2 will be combined to a single value label that describes both variables. This is an easy way to cut down on duplicate information in value labels.\n\n\nlabelrename\nThis user-written command allows you to rename value labels using similar syntax to the rename command. Stata does not allow you to rename value labels using the label values command. This command adds that functionality with the similar syntax as the rename command. One difference is that no wildcards are allowed.\n\n\nlevelsof\nThis command will provide you with a list of all of the unique values of a variable. This comes in handy all of the time when cleaning. A very helpful option that comes with this command is local() in which you can store the list of values as a local. This makes looping through all of the values of a variable possible and easy.\n\n\nlookfor\nThis command searches across all variable names and variable labels, and allows for searching for more than one string or a phrase through the use of \"[string]\". Since lookfor searches across both variable names and variable labels at the same time, it will return a different set of results than ds can.\n\n\nmissing\nThis is not a built-in Stata command and thus you will need to type ssc install missing to get this command before you can use it or read the help file.\nThis group of commands allows for several ways to investigate the missing values in variables. Missing values are typically forgotten about or ignored, but that is a big mistake. They can complicate cleaning and analysis greatly. You should be aware of the missing values and variables in your dataset. This command includes ways to report, list, tag, and drop missing values and variables.\nA very helpful command within this group is missing dropvars which allows you to eliminate variables that are missing on all observations. This is much easier than looping through vars and obs to assert they are missing to drop them.\n\n\nmmerge\nThis is not a built-in Stata command and can be installed by typing ssc install mmerge.\nmmerge provides additional options for merge that make merging datasets more user friendly by removing a signfiicant amount of preprocessing work for complex datasets: - It allows for missing values in the match variable and let’s the user determine how they are treated with the missing() option. - It allows for differing merge variable names with the umatch() option - It allows for all merged variables from the using file to be prefixed as part of the merge with the uname() option - It stores shared variable names that are not merged in a local r(common)\nThere are a number of other options and syntax changes. You can see these by typing help mmerge once mmerge is installed.\n\n\nreturn list\nThis command allows you to see all of the stored results in working memory and their value. For example, if you ran summarize [variarble], the return list command would show all of the scalars stored by summarize. In this case that would be r(N), r(sum_w), and r(sum). Similar commands also allow you to see estimation and system commands using ereturn list and creturn list. The help file (help return list) shows more options.\n\n\nsencode\nThis is not a built-in Stata command and can be installed by typing ssc install sencode.\nsencode makes a number of improvements on the Stata command encode by including a options that allow you to replace the string variable with the numeric variable and set the order of encded values in a user-specified ways, among other user-friendly additions.",

In other words, this means that any Stata command we run is accompanied by multiple options in brackets, [], that alter the output we receive from said command. Other than the command itself, everything in brackets is optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStata is case sensitive!\n\n\n\nAnother important thing about syntax: Stata commands and syntax never come in CAPITAL LETTERS.

Sometimes you may be working alone and can set all your paths with only your own workspace in mind. However, in most cases you will want to write your Stata code in a way that makes it replicable on other computers without additional setup.\nA relative path denotes a file path in relation to the current working directory, while an absolute path denotes a file’s path at a fixed location on a disk. In most cases, you want to use relative paths. Examine the folder shown below. Take notice of the path at the top as well as the subfolders in this folder.\n\n\n\nAbsolute vs. Relative Paths in Stata\n\n\nLet’s assume that your current working directory in Stata is D:\\Files\\Data Cleaning\\Main Data, which is the folder in the picture above. You want to navigate within Stata to the 1 dofiles subfolder. You could achieve this using either of the following codes:\n* Option 1\ncd \"D:\\Files\\Data Cleaning\\Main Data/1 dofiles\"\n\n* Option 2\ncd \"1 dofiles\"\nCode option 1 is an example of using an absolute path; it directs Stata to an exact location every single time you run this code. This means that regardless of your current working directory in Stata, you can always switch to this target directory using Code option 1. However, this code may not work on another computer unless the other user has the Main Data folder located in the path D:\\Files\\Data Cleaning.\nCode option 2 directs Stata to the same folder using a relative path. Based on this code, Stata will assume that you want to move to a folder named 1 dofiles which is located in your current working directory.

Stata provides a list of commands for importing and exporting various data in various formats including Excel spreadsheets (.xls and .xlsx files), text files, and datasets from other software such as SPSS and SAS. Stata can also create and store data in a Stata-format dataset with the filename extension .dta.
