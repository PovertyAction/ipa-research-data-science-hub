> Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) surveys offer unique advantages, such as the ability to assign enumerators randomly without the logistical constraints of in-person surveys (e.g., geographic area, travel costs). However, challenges like Random Digit Dialing (RDD) and respondent tracking require careful planning. This guide provides best practices and tools for conducting effective CATI surveys.

## Remote Surveying in a Pandemic: Handbook

### Executive Summary
Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is a research and policy nonprofit that discovers and promotes effective solutions to global poverty problems. As part of IPA's response to COVID-19, many data collections have shifted to remote modes including CATI, interactive voice response (IVR) and SMS surveys.

This transition has required new protocols, tools, and workflows to ensure high-quality data collection. This document contains tips and best practices for shifting face-to-face surveys to remote modes during pandemic conditions.

IPA's Global Research and Data Support (GRDS) team has created technical tools and protocols that fall into four categories:
1. Data collection
2. Measurement
3. Field logistics
4. Data quality

## CATI Surveys

| Advantages of CATI Surveys | Challenges of CATI Surveys |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Random Enumerator Assignment:** Enumerators can be assigned randomly without geographic or travel constraints. Ensures fairness and reduces bias in data collection. | **Respondent Tracking:** Difficulty in tracking hard-to-reach respondents (e.g., those who refuse to participate or are unavailable). Ensuring representativeness of the sample despite attrition. |
| **Reduced Logistical Constraints:** No need for travel, reducing costs and time. Enumerators can work remotely, increasing flexibility. | **Language Barriers:** Enumerators may not speak the same language as respondents, requiring re-assignment. Limited availability of multilingual enumerators. |
| **Cost-Effectiveness:** Lower operational costs compared to in-person surveys (e.g., no transportation or accommodation expenses). Scalable for large sample sizes. | **Call Refusals:** High refusal rates due to respondent fatigue or distrust of phone surveys. Difficulty in convincing respondents to participate. |
| **Faster Data Collection:** Surveys can be conducted quickly, especially with automated dialing systems. Real-time data entry reduces post-survey processing time. | **Technical Issues:** Dependence on reliable internet and phone connectivity. Challenges with automated dialing systems (e.g., dropped calls, misdials). |
| **Improved Data Quality:** Computer-assisted systems minimize human errors in data entry. Built-in validation checks ensure accurate responses. | **Data Privacy Concerns:** Respondents may be hesitant to share sensitive information over the phone. Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). |
| **Wide Geographic Coverage:** Ability to reach respondents across large or remote areas without physical presence. | **Limited Non-Verbal Cues:** Enumerators cannot observe body language or environmental context, which may affect data interpretation. Difficulty in building rapport with respondents. |
| **Flexibility in Scheduling:** Surveys can be conducted at convenient times for respondents, improving response rates. | **Call Timing:** Respondents may not answer calls during certain times (e.g., work hours). Balancing call attempts to avoid annoying respondents. |
| **Enhanced Monitoring:** Supervisors can monitor calls in real time, ensuring quality control. Automated systems track call outcomes (e.g., completed, refused, invalid). | **Complex Survey Design:** Surveys with long or complex questionnaires may lead to respondent fatigue. Difficulty in maintaining respondent engagement over the phone. |

## 1. Random Enumerator Assignment

### Why Random Assignment Matters
- Ensures fairness in workload distribution.
- Improves replicability of survey administration.

### Tools for Random Assignment

#### Using Stata for Replicable Randomization
```stata
clear all

* Set seed for replicability
gl seednum 3256545
set seed $seednum
set sortseed $seednum

set obs 100
g var = _n
g users = ""

* List of enumerator usernames
gl enumlist = "data001 data002 data003 data013 data032 data035"

* Assign randomly
g rand = runiform() if mi(users)
sort rand
egen enumsl=cut(rand) if mi(users), group(`=wordcount("${enumlist}")')
recode enumsl (0=`=wordcount("${enumlist}")')

forval user=1/`=wordcount("${enumlist}")' {
    replace users = "`=word("${enumlist}", `user')'" if enumsl == `user'
}
drop enumsl

### Choosing to Continue Data Collection during COVID-19

Before shifting to remote data collection, consider:

- Whether data is needed immediately
- If data can be collected safely and ethically
- Feasibility of obtaining reliable phone numbers
- Respondent access to phones with airtime, power, and signal
- Ability to compensate respondents
- Ethics of re-contacting respondents

### Choosing an Appropriate Mode

Recommended modes:

- **CATI**: Best for data quality but requires interviewers
- **IVR**: Lower cost but may frustrate respondents
- **SMS**: Limited by literacy and message length
- **Web**: Less common in low-income countries

### Research Goals by Mode

| Goal                  | CATI | IVR | SMS | Web |
|-----------------------|------|-----|-----|-----|
| Tracking respondents  | ~    | +   | ~   | -   |
| Updating contact info | +    | -   | ~   | ~   |
| Determining language  | +    | +   | -   | +   |
| High-frequency data   | ~    | +*  | +*  | +   |
| Sensitive outcomes    | ~    | ~   | -   | ~   |
| High response rates   | +    | -   | -   | -   |
| Large samples         | -    | +   | ~   | +   |

### IRB and Data Protection

Key considerations:

- Protocol changes for remote surveying
- Interviewer data security
- Informed consent modifications
- Privacy protections

### Interviewer Data Security

- Avoid using personal devices when possible
- Implement strong password protection
- Wipe protected data after collection
- Use masking services for caller ID

### Questionnaire Design

Key Adaptations:

- Reduce survey duration (20-30 minutes max)
- Build in respondent identification
- Create language reassignment protocols
- Include attention checks
- Structure for potential dropped calls

### Sampling Approaches

**Existing Samples:**

- Use numbers from earlier rounds
- Update contact information regularly
- Incentivize respondents to maintain current info

**New Samples:**

- **Unscreened RDD**: Randomly generated numbers  
  - High proportion of ineligible numbers
- **Screened RDD**: Active numbers from mobile operators  
  - More efficient but may miss new numbers

### Infrastructure

**Equipment Options:**

- Cellular Android device for calls and data
- Separate devices for calls and data entry
- Non-cellular device + personal phone (with IRB approval)

**Recommended Software:**

- SurveyCTO (CATI starter kit, field plug-ins)
- Exotel/Twilio for call masking
- Third-party airtime transfer services

### Protocols

**Physical Set-up:**

- Virtual phone banks during pandemic
- Provide necessary equipment (headsets, chargers)
- Ensure reliable internet access

**Call Scheduling Protocol Example:**

| Category         | Example            |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Call frequency   | Every other day    |
| Call hours       | 8am-8pm, Mon-Sat   |
| Max calls        | 5 attempts         |
| Pre-notification | SMS one day before |
| Dialing          | Ring for 1 minute  |
| Rescheduling     | Explicitly offer   |
