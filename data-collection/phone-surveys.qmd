## Key Takeaways

- Phone surveys offer significant advantages in cost-effectiveness, speed, and
  accessibility, making them valuable for data collection in challenging environments.
- Success requires careful consideration of technical feasibility, resource
  availability, and research design compatibility before implementation.
- Different survey modes (CATI, IVR, SMS) have distinct strengths and limitations -
  choosing the right mode depends on research goals, target population, and practical
  constraints.

## 1. Methods and Best Practices

### Introduction

Phone surveys are a cornerstone of data collection for Innovations for Poverty Action
and the research produced by its investigators. As a cost-effective, scalable, and
adaptable method, they have become one of IPA's primary tools for gathering high-quality
data. Particularly in contexts where in-person surveys are logistically challenging or
impractical, phone surveys offer a versatile approach to data collection, allowing
researchers to reach different types of populations efficiently. Whether through live
interviews or interactive voice response (IVR) systems, these surveys can be tailored to
suit various research needs. From monitoring program impacts in real-time to conducting
complex impact evaluation programs, phone surveys enable researchers to maintain
continuity in evidence generation while adhering to ethical and operational constraints.
They are particularly valuable in situations requiring rapid data collection or when
physical access to respondents is limited, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. By
implementing phone surveys, IPA has ensured the continuity and reliability of its
research efforts, even in challenging environments.

This page provides **IPA teams and partners** with:

- **General insights** on the role and advantages of phone surveys in development
  research.
- **Academic research** synthesizing evidence on best practices (e.g., optimizing
  response rates, minimizing attrition).
- **Practical resources** -- handbooks, SurveyCTO templates, and implementation guides -- to design and deploy effective phone surveys.

Whether adapting an existing in-person survey to phone-based methods or launching a new
remote data collection effort, the materials below offer evidence-backed guidance at
every stage.

### What Are Phone Surveys?

Phone surveys are a method of collecting quantitative or qualitative data by contacting
respondents over the phone. Common approaches include:

- **Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI):** Live interviews conducted by
  trained enumerators.
- **Interactive Voice Response (IVR):** Automated surveys where respondents answer on a
  keypad or by voice.
- **SMS/Text-based Surveys:** Questionnaires delivered by text messaging.

### Why Use Phone Surveys?

- **Accessibility:** Reach respondents in hard-to-access regions or during disruptions
  (e.g., pandemics).
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Lower logistical costs compared to in-person surveys.
- **Speed:** Rapid deployment for time-sensitive data (e.g., crisis monitoring).
- **Safety:** Avoid physical contact during health emergencies.

## 2. Weighing the Advantages and Challenges

### Advantages of Phone Surveys

## **Random Enumerator Assignment**

Enumerators can be assigned at random without geographic or travel constraints. Ensures
fairness and reduces bias in data collection.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## **Reduced Logistical Constraints**

No need for travel, reducing costs and time. Enumerators can work remotely, increasing
flexibility.

### Challenges of Phone Surveys

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Respondent Tracking**

Difficulty maintaining contact with respondents over time. Higher attrition rates
compared to in-person surveys.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Language Barriers**

Limited availability of multilingual enumerators. Need for translation services
increases costs.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Call Refusals**

Higher refusal rates compared to in-person surveys. Respondent fatigue with repeated
calls.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Technical Issues**

Dependence on reliable phone networks and internet connectivity. Risk of dropped calls
or poor audio quality.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Data Privacy Concerns**

Challenges in verifying respondent identity. Limited control over privacy during calls.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Limited Non-Verbal Communication**

Cannot observe body language or environmental context. More difficult to build rapport
with respondents.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Call Timing Constraints**

Restricted windows for successful contact. Need to balance persistence with respondent
convenience.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Survey Design Limitations**

Shorter attention spans for phone interviews. Complex questions may be harder to convey
verbally.

## 3. When to Implement Phone Surveys?

After weighing the advantages and challenges, consider these key factors before
implementing phone surveys:

### Essential Criteria

| Criterion                         | Key Questions                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Urgency**                  | - Is immediate data collection necessary? <br> - Can the research questions wait for in-person collection?                                                |
| **Safety and Ethics**             | - Can data be collected safely and ethically? <br> - Are there risks to respondents or enumerators?                                                       |
| **Technical Feasibility**         | - Do you have reliable phone numbers? <br> - Do respondents have consistent phone access? <br> - Is there adequate network coverage?                      |
| **Resource Availability**         | - Can you compensate respondents? <br> - Do you have budget for airtime and equipment? <br> - Are trained enumerators available?                          |
| **Research Design Compatibility** | - Can your research questions be answered by phone? <br> - Is the target population reachable by phone? <br> - Are survey length and complexity suitable? |

### Choosing an Appropriate Mode

Recommended modes:

- **CATI**: Best for data quality but requires interviewers
- **IVR**: Lower cost but may frustrate respondents
- **SMS**: Limited by literacy and message length
- **Web**: Less common in low-income countries
