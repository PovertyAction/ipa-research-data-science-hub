## Key Takeaways

- Phone surveys offer significant advantages in cost-effectiveness, speed, and
  accessibility, making them valuable for data collection in challenging environments.
- Success requires careful consideration of technical feasibility, resource
  availability, and research design compatibility before implementation.
- Different survey modes (CATI, IVR, SMS) have distinct strengths and limitations -
  choosing the right mode depends on research goals, target population, and practical
  constraints.

## 1. Methods and Best Practices

### Introduction

Phone surveys have become essential for development research, particularly when in-person data collection faces logistical challenges or safety constraints. These methods proved invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to offer advantages in hard-to-reach areas, emergency contexts, and time-sensitive research scenarios.

This page provides **IPA teams and partners** with:

- **General insights** on the role and advantages of phone surveys in development
  research.
- **Academic research** synthesizing evidence on best practices (e.g., optimizing
  response rates, minimizing attrition).
- **Practical resources** -- handbooks, SurveyCTO templates, and implementation guides -- to design and deploy effective phone surveys.

Whether adapting an existing in-person survey to phone-based methods or launching a new
remote data collection effort, the materials below offer evidence-backed guidance at
every stage.

### What Are Phone Surveys?

Phone surveys are a method of collecting quantitative or qualitative data by contacting
respondents over the phone. Common approaches include:

- **Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI):** Live interviews conducted by
  trained enumerators.
- **Interactive Voice Response (IVR):** Automated surveys where respondents answer on a
  keypad or by voice.
- **SMS/Text-based Surveys:** Questionnaires delivered by text messaging.

### Why Use Phone Surveys?

- **Accessibility:** Reach respondents in hard-to-access regions or during disruptions
  (e.g., pandemics).
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Lower logistical costs compared to in-person surveys.
- **Speed:** Rapid deployment for time-sensitive data (e.g., crisis monitoring).
- **Safety:** Avoid physical contact during health emergencies.

## 2. Weighing the Advantages and Challenges

### Advantages of Phone Surveys

### Challenges of Phone Surveys

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Respondent Tracking**

Difficulty maintaining contact with respondents over time. Higher attrition rates
compared to in-person surveys.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Language Barriers**

Limited availability of multilingual enumerators. Need for translation services
increases costs.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Call Refusals**

Higher refusal rates compared to in-person surveys. Respondent fatigue with repeated
calls.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Technical Issues**

Dependence on reliable phone networks and internet connectivity. Risk of dropped calls
or poor audio quality.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Data Privacy Concerns**

Challenges in verifying respondent identity. Limited control over privacy during calls.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Limited Non-Verbal Communication**

Cannot observe body language or environmental context. More difficult to build rapport
with respondents.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Call Timing Constraints**

Restricted windows for successful contact. Need to balance persistence with respondent
convenience.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}

## **Survey Design Limitations**

## 3. When to Implement Phone Surveys?

After weighing the advantages and challenges, consider these key factors before
implementing phone surveys:

### Essential Criteria

| Criterion                         | Key Questions                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Urgency**                  | - Is immediate data collection necessary? <br> - Can the research questions wait for in-person collection?                                                |
| **Safety and Ethics**             | - Can data be collected safely and ethically? <br> - Are there risks to respondents or enumerators?                                                       |
| **Technical Feasibility**         | - Do you have reliable phone numbers? <br> - Do respondents have consistent phone access? <br> - Is there adequate network coverage?                      |
| **Resource Availability**         | - Can you compensate respondents? <br> - Do you have budget for airtime and equipment? <br> - Are trained enumerators available?                          |
| **Research Design Compatibility** | - Can your research questions be answered by phone? <br> - Is the target population reachable by phone? <br> - Are survey length and complexity suitable? |

### Choosing an Appropriate Mode

Recommended modes:

- **CATI**: Best for data quality but requires interviewers
- **IVR**: Lower cost but may frustrate respondents
- **SMS**: Limited by literacy and message length
- **Web**: Less common in low-income countries
