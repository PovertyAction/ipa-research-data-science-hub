## Survey Plan
<small>[page link](survey-plan.qmd)</small>

<div class="image-container left">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_survey_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
    The <span class="highlight">survey plan</span> is an operational plan that covers timelines, staffing needs, logistics, and procurement for your survey, for all stages including questionnaire development, training, piloting, tracking, interviews, and quality assurance. Your survey plan must be in line with your budget(s); for example, you cannot survey more respondents in the baseline than your budget estimated -- without overspending during your endline.
  </p>
</div>

## Data Quality Action Plan
<small>[page link](dqap.qmd)</small>

<div class="image-container right">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_crisis_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
    The <span class="highlight">data quality action plan</span> lays out in detail the requirements for backchecks, high frequency checks, accompaniments, spot checks, and any other data quality action activities. The scope of the data quality action plan should not only include technical products (e.g. customizing the high frequency check template), but also data flow, roles and responsibilities, reporting schedules, actionable items based on output, and incentive programs for the field team. It also includes your staffing needs, which may change over the course of the survey (e.g., accompaniments become less frequent later in the survey).
  </p>
</div>

## Bench Test
<small>[page link](bench-test.qmd)</small>

<div class="image-container left">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_training_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Bench testing</span> means testing your survey in the office with a minimum of three different testers. You will save time and money by making sure your survey works well BEFORE launching field data collection. Bench testing is an iterative process wherein testers run the survey in different scenarios and provide feedback, while the programmer(s) make changes; note that even small changes to a survey must go through the bench testing process again, as it is easy to make mistakes that affect other parts of the survey. This process works best if the "paper" survey is considered mostly complete and has already been reviewed by central decision-makers on the project.
  </p>
</div>

## Pilot Survey
<small>[page link](pilot-survey.qmd)</small>

<div class="image-container right">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_qualitative_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
    Every survey must be <span class="highlight">piloted</span> prior to the beginning of the survey in communities outside your study sample. Your pilot should look as close to actual surveying as possible -- you may even decide not to tell your field team it is a pilot. Ideally, every question that is included in the final survey should be piloted prior to launch. For surveys using DDC, a pilot should include field testing of both the survey program and devices. Remember to leave time to make corrections to errors you identified during piloting.
  </p>
</div>

## Accompany Surveyors
<small>[page link](accompany-surveyors.qmd)</small>

<div class="image-container left">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_field staff_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
    Field supervisors must <span class="highlight">accompany</span> a subset of field officers' interviews to monitor field officer performance and to check for survey issues. All field officers must be personally accompanied at least once during the first week of the survey. Accompaniments can be scaled down as the survey progresses, especially by leveraging digital supplements like audio recordings and meta-data.
  </p>
</div>

## High Frequency Checks
<small>[page link](hfc.qmd)</small>

<div class="image-container right">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_research question_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">High frequency checks (HFCs)</span> provide insight into ongoing field team and data quality concerns before they become too entrenched or too late to manage. By running HFCs, you can regularly analyze (comparative) field officer performance, compliance with ethics requirements, response frequencies and outliers, duplicates, and other project-specific data quality issues. HFCs are meant to provide the evidence needed to successfully guide and manage a field team on a daily basis, and thus must be accompanied by strict guidance on roles and responsibilities, reporting schedules, and triggered actions (e.g. what outliers would trigger re-interviewing a household).
  </p>
</div>

## Backchecks
<small>[page link](backchecks.qmd)</small>

<div class="image-container left">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_results_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
    A <span class="highlight">backcheck</span> (also known as a field audit or re-interview) refers to when a highly qualified field officer (also known as a backchecker) visits a respondent a second time to re-administer a selection of questions from the original questionnaire. Those backcheck responses are then compared to the original responses. The bcstats program helps you to identify discrepancies between answers, and thus to identify problems with your questionnaire, your field team, or both. Your quality assurance plan should have included a backcheck randomization plan, as well as an action plan for what to do when you encounter discrepancies.
  </p>
</div>

## Double Entry
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/dataentry)</small>

<div class="image-container right">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_research paper_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
    Although paper surveying is now uncommon, there are strict protocols for <span class="highlight">data entry from paper surveys</span>. Each survey must be entered by two separate data entry operators who cannot compare responses. When there are discrepancies between their entries, they must be reconciled by a third data entry operator who looks at the original survey closely. In-house data entry can be replaced by online firms such as Captricity, which also provide double entry and allow for you to review discrepancies against the original survey responses.
  </p>
</div>

## Maintain active IRB approval
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/irb-guidelines)</small>

<div class="image-container left">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_violence_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
        All research projects must maintain <span class="highlight">active IRB approval</span> throughout the duration of the study. This includes obtaining initial approval before any data collection begins, submitting amendments for any protocol changes, and completing annual renewals as required. Ensure all team members are aware of and follow the approved protocols.
  </p>
</div>

## Create data security protocols
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/data-security-guidelines)</small>

<div class="image-container right">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_ICT_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
        <span class="highlight">Data security protocols</span> must be established before data collection begins. This includes defining roles and access levels, setting up encryption methods, establishing secure data transfer procedures, and creating protocols for handling sensitive information. Document all procedures and ensure team members are trained on proper implementation.
  </p>
</div>

## Follow data security protocols
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/data-security-compliance)</small>

<div class="image-container left">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_monitoring _ evaluation_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
        Strict adherence to <span class="highlight">data security protocols</span> is mandatory throughout the project. This includes using encrypted devices, secure file transfer methods, and following established procedures for data handling. Regular compliance checks should be conducted to ensure protocols are being followed correctly.
  </p>
</div>

## Unique IDs for anonymization
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/unique-id-guidelines)</small>

<div class="image-container right">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_organizational structure_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
        <span class="highlight">Unique identification systems</span> must be implemented to protect respondent privacy. This includes creating and maintaining a secure system for generating and tracking unique IDs, keeping identifying information separate from survey data, and establishing protocols for linking datasets while maintaining anonymity.
  </p>
</div>

## Complete IRB closeout process
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/irb-closeout)</small>

<div class="image-container left">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_irb.png" width="20%">
  <p>
        The <span class="highlight">IRB closeout process</span> is the final step in ensuring compliance with ethical standards after completing research activities. Teams must ensure that all research activities are properly documented, any unexpected events are reported, and the project is officially closed with the IRB. This includes submitting final reports, archiving data securely, and maintaining all records as required.
  </p>
</div>

## Maintain data backups
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/backup-guidelines)</small>

<div class="image-container right">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_backup.png" width="20%">
  <p>
      Regular <span class="highlight">data backups</span> must be maintained throughout the project. Implement automated backup systems, verify backup integrity regularly, and ensure multiple copies are stored in secure locations. Document backup procedures and maintain logs of backup activities.
  </p>
</div>

## Store all files on Box
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/box-guidelines)</small>

<div class="image-container left">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_box.png" width="20%">
  <p>
        All project files must be <span class="highlight">stored on Box</span> following IPA's organizational structure. This ensures proper version control, facilitates collaboration, and maintains security standards. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance with storage protocols.
  </p>
</div>

## Register with AEA
<small>[page link](https://ipastorage.box.com/v/aea-registration)</small>

<div class="image-container right">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_aea.png" width="20%">
  <p>
        All applicable studies must be <span class="highlight">registered with AEA</span> prior to data collection. This includes providing study details, pre-analysis plans, and maintaining updated registration information throughout the project. Ensure all required documentation is submitted and maintained.
  </p>
