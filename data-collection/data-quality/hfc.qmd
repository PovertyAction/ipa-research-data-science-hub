> This page is an overall guide to IPA's format for High Frequency Checks. High Frequency Checks (HFCs) are one of the Minimum Must-Dos that contribute to IPA’s standard of data quality assurance.

## What are High Frequency Checks?

<div class="image-container top">
  <img src="/assets/images/mmds_research question_black.png" width="20%">
  <p>
High Frequency Checks (HFCs) are systematic checks performed on survey data at regular intervals, such as daily or weekly, during data collection. These checks help identify and correct issues or mistakes in the survey process promptly, ensuring the data collected is of high quality. By catching errors early, teams can make necessary adjustments to the survey or data collection methods, leading to more reliable and accurate data.
    </p>

## High Frequency Checks Overview

High-frequency checks (HFCs) evaluate different aspects of the data collection process and are completed regularly as new data is collected. At IPA/J-PAL, HFCs are typically implemented in Stata after the data flow is complete. These checks provide insights into:

- The quality of the data
- Enumerator performance
- Errors in the electronic survey program
- Systematic flaws in the data flow

Given their importance, high-frequency checks are one of the major benefits of Computer-Assisted Interviewing (CAI). Unlike CAI logic checks, which are pre-programmed into the survey tool, HFCs are conducted post-data collection to identify trends across surveys.

### Types of High Frequency Checks

#### **Daily Logic Checks**
- Verify the survey form version
- Detect duplicate observations and unique variable duplicates (e.g., GPS, phone number)
- Ensure critical variables are not missing
- Identify variables with all missing values
- Review "Other specify" values
- Detect outliers in numeric variables
- Review field comments
- Track survey progress

#### **Enumerator Performance Checks (Dashboard)**
- Percentage of "Don't know" and "Refuse to answer"
- "Yes" percentage for filter questions
- Enumerator productivity
- Average interview duration
- Active hours
- Statistics for numeric variables

#### **Survey Dashboard Checks**
- Survey consent rate
- Percentage of missing survey values
- Percentage of "Don't know" & "Refuse to Answer"
- Number and percentage of "Other specify" values
- Variables with all missing values
- Survey productivity

## Introduction to IPA's HFCs Package

The Stata program `ipacheck` is a set of user-written commands developed and maintained by IPA. It consists of three types of files: an input file, a do-file, and output files. These files can be modified to fit your project’s needs. Each check produces either a standalone workbook or a dedicated sheet in the HFC output workbook, displaying respondent IDs, enumerator details, and relevant flagged variables.

### **How are High Frequency Checks different from the Data Management System?**
The Data Management System (DMS) provides a structured approach to managing research data, assisting with:

- Creating project folder structures
- Managing data flow
- Running high-frequency checks
- De-duplicating and replacing data
- Tracking survey progress
- Running back checks
- Generating logs for project closure

High-frequency checks are just one component of the broader capabilities of the DMS, running alongside other project management tools.

## Installation

`ipacheck` is IPA’s Stata package for running high-frequency checks. The package includes various programs categorized as main or ancillary.

### **Main Programs**
- `ipacheckcorrections` - Make corrections to data.
- `ipacheckspecifyrecode` - Recode "Other specify" values.
- `ipacheckversions` - Export survey form version statistics & flag outdated submissions.
- `ipacheckids` - Identify duplicate survey IDs.
- `ipacheckdups` - Detect duplicates in non-ID variables.
- `ipacheckmissing` - Generate missingness & distinctness statistics.
- `ipacheckoutliers` - Identify outliers in numeric variables.
- `ipacheckspecify` - Extract "Other specify" values.
- `ipacheckcomments` - Export field comments from SurveyCTO.
- `ipachecktextaudit` - Analyze survey duration using SurveyCTO text audit files.
- `ipachecktimeuse` - Export engagement statistics from SurveyCTO audit files.
- `ipachecksurveydb` - Generate general dataset statistics.
- `ipacheckenumdb` - Evaluate enumerator performance.
- `ipatracksurvey` - Generate a dashboard for tracking survey progress.
- `ipabcstats` - Compare survey data with back check data.

### **Ancillary Programs**
- `ipacodebook` - Export a codebook to Excel with labeled variable notes.

`ipacheck` comes with a structured project folder setup, including a master do-file, global variables file, preparation do-file, and Excel-based input sheets. Outputs are generated as well-formatted Excel spreadsheets for field team distribution. Since version 4.2.0, `ipacheck` now incorporates programs from the `ipahelper` package.

### **Installation Steps**
```stata
* Install ipacheck from GitHub
net install ipacheck, all replace from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PovertyAction/high-frequency-checks/master")

* Update ipacheck anytime
ipacheck update

* Create a new project with folder structure and input files
ipacheck new, surveys("SURVEY_NAME_1") folder("path/to/project")

* Create a project with multiple surveys using subfolders
ipacheck new, surveys("SURVEY_NAME_1" "SURVEY_NAME_2") folder("path/to/project") subfolders

* Obtain fresh copies of the master do-file and Excel inputs
ipacheck new, filesonly

* Access IPA's training exercise (includes sample data and instructions)
ipacheck new, exercise

* Verify the installed version
ipacheck version
```
