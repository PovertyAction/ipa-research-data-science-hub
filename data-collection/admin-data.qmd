## What is Administrative Data?

Administrative data refers to information systematically collected, stored, and used for program operation and management decisions. Unlike data collected specifically for research purposes, administrative data exists primarily to support the day-to-day administration of programs, services, or institutions.

This type of data encompasses a broad spectrum of information sources:

- **Financial Data**: Credit card transactions, bank records, loan portfolios, insurance claims
- **Healthcare Data**: Electronic medical records, patient visits, treatment outcomes, service utilization
- **Educational Data**: Student enrollment records, attendance data, academic performance metrics
- **Government Data**: Tax filings, social service records, regulatory compliance data, arrest records, mortality records

The fundamental characteristic that distinguishes administrative data is its operational purpose—it serves the immediate needs of program management while potentially offering valuable insights for monitoring and evaluation activities.

## The Value Proposition of Administrative Data

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Cost-Effectiveness and Scale
Administrative data presents compelling economic advantages over traditional survey-based data collection. Because this information is already being systematically gathered for operational purposes, incorporating it into monitoring and evaluation strategies can dramatically reduce both direct costs and time investments.

The scale advantages are particularly significant. Administrative systems typically capture data from entire populations of program participants, creating large sample sizes that would be prohibitively expensive to achieve through primary data collection. This comprehensive coverage enables more robust statistical analyses and increases confidence in findings.

## Accuracy and Reliability Benefits
Administrative data can offer superior accuracy compared to self-reported survey data in many contexts. Participants may underreport sensitive behaviors, struggle with recall of specific details, or provide socially desirable responses in survey settings. Administrative records, by contrast, capture actual behaviors and transactions as they occur.

For example, financial borrowing is frequently underreported in household surveys, while administrative records from lending institutions provide precise documentation of loan amounts, terms, and repayment histories. Similarly, attendance records offer more reliable data than self-reported participation rates.

## Timeliness and Responsiveness
The regular updating of administrative systems enables more responsive monitoring activities. Rather than waiting for periodic survey rounds, program managers can access near real-time information about implementation progress, participant engagement, and early outcome indicators.

This timeliness facilitates adaptive management approaches, allowing for course corrections based on emerging data patterns. Implementation issues can be identified and addressed more quickly, and key performance indicators can be tracked continuously rather than at discrete intervals.

Organizations should balance data quality, actionability, and resource allocation when incorporating administrative data into their research design. Data accuracy and reliability should take precedence over cost savings.

## Accessing Administrative Data

Accessing administrative data involves several key steps and considerations:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Finding Administrative Data
Implementing partners and government agencies are valuable sources of administrative data. Common sources include:

- **Health Data**: Regional/national health departments, hospitals, health insurance records
- **Financial Data**: Banks, credit unions, credit reporting agencies
- **Education Data**: Schools, ministries of education, standardized testing agencies
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Formulating a Data Request
When requesting administrative data, researchers should:

- Define the timeframe, format, and structure needed
- List specific variables of interest
- Specify whether identified or de-identified data is required
- Avoid broad requests (e.g., “all data”), as this can delay approvals
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Data Flow Strategies
A well-planned data flow strategy ensures smooth integration of administrative data:

1. **Gather Identifying Information**: Determine what identifiers are available in the study sample
2. **Link Data Sets**: Use pre-existing identifiers to match study data with administrative data
3. **Choose a Matching Strategy**: Decide between exact or probabilistic matching
4. **Determine Who Performs the Link**: Clarify whether the data provider, researcher, or a third party will conduct the linkage
:::

## Ethical Considerations

Using administrative data in research requires adherence to ethical and legal standards:

### Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval

Most research using administrative data qualifies as human subjects research and requires IRB approval, including:

- Proper handling of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Justification for using identified vs. de-identified data
- Security measures for protecting sensitive information

### Informed Consent

Researchers may need to obtain informed consent from participants before accessing administrative data, depending on:

- The type of data being accessed
- Whether it is possible to de-identify the data
- Legal requirements set by the data provider

### Data Security and Compliance

Researchers must implement robust security measures:

- Encryption for storing and transferring sensitive data
- Access controls to limit data exposure
- Compliance with legal regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA (if applicable)

## Challenges and Limitations

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Scope Limitations
Administrative data systems are designed to serve specific operational needs, which creates inherent limitations for monitoring and evaluation purposes. Most significantly, these systems typically only capture information about program participants, excluding non-participants, those deemed ineligible, or individuals who declined to participate.

This participant-only focus limits the types of evaluation questions that can be addressed using administrative data alone. Impact evaluations require comparison groups, which are rarely available in administrative systems. Additionally, the socioeconomic and demographic information captured in administrative records is usually limited to what's operationally necessary, providing less comprehensive participant profiles than purpose-designed surveys.

The temporal scope of administrative data is also constrained by program lifecycles. While this may be sufficient for monitoring program inputs or measuring uptake and usage, outcomes that emerge after program completion require alternative data sources.

## Data Quality Concerns
The quality of administrative data varies significantly across organizations and systems. Unlike research-oriented data collection, administrative systems often lack rigorous quality control mechanisms. Data collection, entry, and management practices may be decentralized, leading to inconsistencies across different units within the same organization.

Incentive structures can further compromise data quality. When staff face performance targets or bonus structures tied to specific metrics, there may be pressure to manipulate or falsify reported data. These quality issues can be particularly problematic because they may not be immediately apparent to external users of the data.

The decentralized nature of many administrative systems means that different departments may use varying collection, cleaning, and reporting procedures, resulting in inconsistent data quality across an organization's records.

## Access and Usability Challenges
Even when high-quality administrative data exists, obtaining access to usable information can be surprisingly difficult. Data may exist only in paper formats stored across multiple locations, requiring significant time and resources for digitization. Digital records often require extraction by specialized personnel, creating bottlenecks and delays.

Staff turnover can compound these challenges, particularly when institutional knowledge about data systems, storage locations, or extraction procedures is concentrated among a few individuals. The time required to obtain usable administrative data must be planned for well in advance of intended use.

Legal and regulatory requirements may create additional barriers to accessing administrative data, particularly when the information contains personally identifiable details or when the intended use extends beyond the original collection purpose.
:::

### Differential Coverage

Treatment and control groups may appear differently in administrative records, leading to bias:

- **Identifiers Obtained After Enrollment**: Participants in the treatment group may be more likely to provide identifying information
- **Program-Generated Data**: If the intervention influences data collection, results may be skewed

### Cost Considerations

Administrative data sets vary in cost, depending on:

- The number of records requested
- File-years needed
- Data preparation time required by the provider

## Strategic Considerations for Implementation

Administrative data works best as part of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation strategy rather than as a standalone solution. Understanding when and how to leverage administrative data requires careful consideration of program objectives, available resources, and the specific strengths and limitations of potential data sources.

The CART principle of responsibility provides a framework for making these decisions. This principle emphasizes finding the right balance between collecting sufficient data to obtain credible, actionable information and the costs associated with data collection and analysis.

When administrative data can provide the necessary information at acceptable quality levels, it often represents an efficient use of resources. However, when data quality is questionable or scope limitations prevent addressing key evaluation questions, investing in primary data collection may be more appropriate.

## Practical Implementation Framework

Understanding the theoretical benefits and challenges of administrative data is only the beginning. Successful implementation requires a systematic approach that addresses the practical realities of working with existing data systems.

The implementation process typically involves eight key steps: identifying appropriate data sources, understanding data characteristics and limitations, reviewing available documentation, assessing data quality, establishing unique identification methods, completing legal agreements, addressing regulatory requirements, and preparing data management systems.

Each step presents potential obstacles that must be anticipated and managed. Data sources may not align perfectly with evaluation needs. Documentation may be incomplete or misleading. Quality may be inconsistent across different parts of the dataset. Legal and regulatory requirements may create delays or access restrictions.

Success requires early engagement with potential data providers, realistic timelines that account for unexpected delays, and contingency plans for addressing common implementation challenges.

## IPA Examples

IPA has successfully utilized administrative data across numerous projects worldwide. In financial inclusion evaluations, bank records have provided precise measurements of savings behavior, loan uptake, and repayment patterns that would be difficult to capture accurately through surveys alone.

Educational programs have leveraged school administrative data to track attendance, enrollment, and academic performance over time, enabling long-term impact assessments while reducing data collection costs. Healthcare interventions have utilized patient records and insurance claims data to measure service utilization and health outcomes.

These applications demonstrate both the potential and the challenges of working with administrative data. Success typically requires early engagement with data providers, careful assessment of data quality, and realistic expectations about what questions can be answered with available information.

## Conclusion

Administrative data is a powerful tool for randomized evaluations, offering cost-effective, accurate, and comprehensive insights. However, researchers must navigate ethical, legal, and logistical challenges to ensure data quality and validity. By following standardized processes, addressing ethical concerns, and mitigating common challenges, researchers can effectively leverage administrative data for impactful research.
