## What is Stata?

Stata is a statistical software package that is commonly used in the social sciences and economics.
It is widely used at IPA for data analysis and management. It offers a comprehensive
library of methods for data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and econometric analysis.
Stata is very well suited for research data workflows and research design tasks,
including power calculations, sample design adjustments, panel data analysis,
time series analysis, etc. See [Stata Features](https://www.stata.com/features/)
for a full list of what Stata makes available.

> Administrative data refers to information collected, used, and stored primarily for operational purposes rather than research. These data can be a valuable resource for research and impact evaluation. This document provides practical guidance on obtaining and using nonpublic administrative data for randomized evaluations.

## Introduction
This page provides practical guidance on accessing and using nonpublic administrative data for randomized evaluations. Administrative data is typically collected by government agencies and organizations for registration, transaction, and record-keeping purposes. Examples include credit card transactions, electronic medical records, insurance claims, educational records, arrest records, and mortality records.

This page covers:

- Standard processes for accessing administrative data
- Ethical considerations for using administrative data in randomized evaluations
- Common challenges when working with administrative data

## **1. Standard Processes for Accessing Administrative Data**
Accessing administrative data typically involves several steps. Below are key considerations:

### Finding Administrative Data
Implementing partners and government agencies are valuable sources of administrative data. Common sources include:

- **Health Data**: Regional/national health departments, hospitals, health insurance records
- **Financial Data**: Banks, credit unions, credit reporting agencies
- **Education Data**: Schools, ministries of education, standardized testing agencies

### Formulating a Data Request
When requesting administrative data, researchers should:

- Define the timeframe, format, and structure needed
- List specific variables of interest
- Specify whether identified or de-identified data is required
- Avoid broad requests (e.g., "all data"), as this can delay approvals

### Data Flow Strategies
A well-planned data flow strategy ensures smooth integration of administrative data:

1. **Gather Identifying Information**: Determine what identifiers are available in the study sample.
2. **Link Data Sets**: Use pre-existing identifiers to match study data with administrative data.
3. **Choose a Matching Strategy**: Decide between exact or probabilistic matching.
4. **Determine Who Performs the Link**: Clarify whether the data provider, researcher, or a third party will conduct the linkage.

## **2. Ethical Considerations for Using Administrative Data in RCTs**
Using administrative data in research requires adherence to ethical and legal standards. Key considerations include:

### Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval
Most research using administrative data qualifies as human subjects research and requires IRB approval. This includes ensuring:

- Proper handling of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Justification for using identified vs. de-identified data
- Security measures for protecting sensitive information

### Informed Consent
In some cases, researchers may need to obtain informed consent from participants before accessing administrative data. This depends on:

- The type of data being accessed
- Whether it is possible to de-identify the data
- Legal requirements set by the data provider

### Data Security and Compliance
Researchers must implement robust security measures, including:

- Encryption for storing and transferring sensitive data
- Access controls to limit data exposure
- Compliance with legal regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA (if applicable)

For further clarification on IRB-related issues, any project with concerns should email [humansubjects@poverty-action.org](mailto:humansubjects@poverty-action.org).

## **3. Common Challenges When Using Administrative Data**
While administrative data offers many advantages, researchers often face challenges such as:

### Differential Coverage
Treatment and control groups may appear differently in administrative records, leading to bias. Examples include:

- **Identifiers Obtained After Enrollment**: Participants in the treatment group may be more likely to provide identifying information.
- **Program-Generated Data**: If the intervention influences data collection, results may be skewed.

### Reporting Bias
Some administrative data relies on self-reporting, which can introduce inaccuracies. Examples include:

- **Incentives for Misreporting**: Agencies or individuals may have reasons to over- or under-report data.
- **Human Error in Data Entry**: Manual data entry can introduce inconsistencies.

### Cost of Administrative Data
Administrative data sets vary in cost, depending on:

- The number of records requested
- File-years needed
- Data preparation time required by the provider

## Conclusion
Administrative data is a powerful tool for randomized evaluations, offering cost-effective, accurate, and comprehensive insights. However, researchers must navigate ethical, legal, and logistical challenges to ensure data quality and validity. By following standardized processes, addressing ethical concerns, and mitigating common challenges, researchers can effectively leverage administrative data for impactful research.
