## 1. Methods and Best Practices

### Introduction

Phone surveys are a cornerstone of data collection for Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) and the research produced by its investigators. As a cost-effective, scalable, and adaptable method, they have become one of IPA’s primary tools for gathering high-quality data. Particularly in contexts where in-person surveys are logistically challenging or impractical, phone surveys offer a versatile approach to data collection, allowing researchers to reach different types of populations efficiently. Whether through live interviews or interactive voice response (IVR) systems, these surveys can be tailored to suit various research needs. From monitoring program impacts in real-time to conducting complex impact evaluation programs, phone surveys enable researchers to maintain continuity in evidence generation while adhering to ethical and operational constraints. They are particularly valuable in situations requiring rapid data collection or when physical access to respondents is limited, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. By implementing phone surveys, IPA has ensured the continuity and reliability of its research efforts, even in challenging environments.

This page provides **IPA teams and partners** with:

- **General insights** on the role and advantages of phone surveys in development research.
- **Academic research** synthesizing evidence on best practices (e.g., optimizing response rates, minimizing attrition).
- **Practical resources**—including handbooks, SurveyCTO templates, and implementation guides—to design and deploy effective phone surveys.

Whether adapting an existing in-person survey to phone-based methods or launching a new remote data collection effort, the materials below offer evidence-backed guidance at every stage.

### What Are Phone Surveys?
Phone surveys are a method of collecting quantitative or qualitative data by contacting respondents over the phone. Common approaches include:

- **Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI):** Live interviews conducted by trained enumerators.
- **Interactive Voice Response (IVR):** Automated surveys where respondents answer via keypad or voice.
- **SMS/Text-based Surveys:** Questionnaires delivered via text messaging.

### Why Use Phone Surveys?

- **Accessibility:** Reach respondents in hard-to-access regions or during disruptions (e.g., pandemics).
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Lower logistical costs compared to in-person surveys.
- **Speed:** Rapid deployment for time-sensitive data (e.g., crisis monitoring).
- **Safety:** Avoid physical contact during health emergencies.


## 2. Weighing the Advantages and Challenges

## See key takeaways

Phone surveys offer significant advantages in terms of cost, speed, and accessibility, but they also present unique challenges that must be carefully managed. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for deciding whether phone surveys are appropriate for your research project.
:::

| Advantages of Phone Surveys | Challenges of Phone Surveys |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Random Enumerator Assignment:** Enumerators can be assigned randomly without geographic or travel constraints. Ensures fairness and reduces bias in data collection. | **Respondent Tracking:** Difficulty in tracking hard-to-reach respondents (e.g., those who refuse to participate or are unavailable). Ensuring representativeness of the sample despite attrition. |
| **Reduced Logistical Constraints:** No need for travel, reducing costs and time. Enumerators can work remotely, increasing flexibility. | **Language Barriers:** Enumerators may not speak the same language as respondents, requiring re-assignment. Limited availability of multilingual enumerators. |
| **Cost-Effectiveness:** Lower operational costs compared to in-person surveys (e.g., no transportation or accommodation expenses). Scalable for large sample sizes. | **Call Refusals:** High refusal rates due to respondent fatigue or distrust of phone surveys. Difficulty in convincing respondents to participate. |
| **Faster Data Collection:** Surveys can be conducted quickly, especially with automated dialing systems. Real-time data entry reduces post-survey processing time. | **Technical Issues:** Dependence on reliable internet and phone connectivity. Challenges with automated dialing systems (e.g., dropped calls, misdials). |
| **Improved Data Quality:** Computer-assisted systems minimize human errors in data entry. Built-in validation checks ensure accurate responses. | **Data Privacy Concerns:** Respondents may be hesitant to share sensitive information over the phone. Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). |
| **Wide Geographic Coverage:** Ability to reach respondents across large or remote areas without physical presence. | **Limited Non-Verbal Cues:** Enumerators cannot observe body language or environmental context, which may affect data interpretation. Difficulty in building rapport with respondents. |
| **Flexibility in Scheduling:** Surveys can be conducted at convenient times for respondents, improving response rates. | **Call Timing:** Respondents may not answer calls during certain times (e.g., work hours). Balancing call attempts to avoid annoying respondents. |
| **Enhanced Monitoring:** Supervisors can monitor calls in real time, ensuring quality control. Automated systems track call outcomes (e.g., completed, refused, invalid). | **Complex Survey Design:** Surveys with long or complex questionnaires may lead to respondent fatigue. Difficulty in maintaining respondent engagement over the phone. |


## 3. When to Implement Phone Surveys?

After weighing the advantages and challenges, consider these key factors before implementing phone surveys:

### Essential Criteria

1. **Data Urgency:**

- Is immediate data collection necessary?
- Can the research questions wait for in-person collection?

2. **Safety & Ethics:**

- Can data be collected safely and ethically?
- Are there risks to respondents or enumerators?

3. **Technical Feasibility:**

- Do you have reliable phone numbers?
- Do respondents have consistent phone access?
- Is there adequate network coverage?

4. **Resource Availability:**

- Can you compensate respondents?
- Do you have budget for airtime and equipment?
- Are trained enumerators available?

5. **Research Design Compatibility:**

- Can your research questions be answered via phone?
- Is the target population reachable by phone?
- Are survey length and complexity suitable?

### Choosing an Appropriate Mode

Recommended modes:

- **CATI**: Best for data quality but requires interviewers
- **IVR**: Lower cost but may frustrate respondents
- **SMS**: Limited by literacy and message length
- **Web**: Less common in low-income countries
