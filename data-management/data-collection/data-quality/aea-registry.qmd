> This page will explain why it is important to do AEA registry, how to do so, and guide your PIs through the process.

## What is the AEA RCT Registry and why is it important?

The AEA RCT Registry is a website for registering RCTs in the social sciences, established by the American Economics Association. It is important because it combats publication bias by providing a public record of the study. Pre-registration is a long-standing requirement in the medical community (e.g., for FDA approval, for publication in medical journals), and it is increasingly becoming a focus in the social sciences as well.

### How to create a trial on behalf of someone else (i.e., you are not the ‘lead’ investigator or Primary Investigator):

1. Log in to your AEA Registry account.
2. Create a trial from the main page by clicking on **“Register a Trial.”**
3. Fill out the required fields (highlighted in red) and any other available study information.
4. Upload a pre-analysis plan (optional, can be added later).
5. When ready for the PI to review the trial, add them as a collaborator:
   - From the draft trial main page, click the **“Manage Collaborator”** button (orange, upper right corner).
   - Add collaborators using their registered email address.

#### **Managing Collaborators:**

- Click the **“Add Collaborator”** field and enter each person’s registered email.
- Scroll down and press **“Save.”**
- Change the email in the ‘Primary Investigator’ field from your email to the PI’s email via the dropdown menu.
- The **“Trial Information”** page will update automatically with the assigned PI.

### What to do before clicking the **"Register Trial"** button:

1. Have the PI review the draft registration for accuracy and completeness.
2. Make any necessary modifications.
3. Click the **“Register Trial”** button to finalize registration.

### What happens once my trial reaches its **“Trial End Date”** in the registry?
- The registry system uses the end date to remind PIs to update the trial and to publish hidden fields via an automated email.

Dear [-PI name-],

I have created a draft registration for your trial “[-trial name-]” in the AEA RCT Registry (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org). For the draft, I was able to complete most of the required fields by reviewing your [-name of documents-], but there is still some information that is missing. Before the trial can be officially registered, you must add the following information:

[-list what is missing for mandatory fields-]

To complete registration, please log in and:
- Review the draft registration at [-direct link here-], checking for accuracy, and any additional information you may want to include.
- Make any necessary changes or modifications.
- Click the **“Register Trial”** button to complete the registration.

Let me know if you have any questions. I am adding you to this trial right now, so you should receive an automated email from the registry system.

Best regards,
[-Your name-]

### **Email to a New PI:**
```markdown
Dear [-PI name-],

In an effort to register IPA projects in the American Economic Association’s registry for randomized controlled trials (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org), I have drafted a registration for your trial “[-trial name-].” Before the trial can be officially registered and first reviewed by you, please create an account at: https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/users/sign_up and then follow the prompt to confirm your email. Once you have an account, I can add you as a collaborator to review and publish this trial.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[-Your name-]
