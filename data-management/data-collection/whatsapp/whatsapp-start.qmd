WhatsApp has become a powerful tool for data collection, offering a cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly alternative to traditional survey methods. At IPA, WhatsApp surveys have been used to overcome challenges in reaching participants, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This page provides an introduction to WhatsApp surveys, their benefits, limitations, and best practices based on our experience.

## Why Use WhatsApp for Surveys?

1. **Wide User Base**
   - WhatsApp has over 2 billion active users globally.
   - It is widely adopted across different demographics and regions.

2. **High Engagement and Familiarity**
   - People are already comfortable using WhatsApp for communication.
   - Surveys can be completed easily on smartphones, anytime and anywhere.

3. **Cost-Effective Solution**
   - WhatsApp reduces costs compared to traditional survey methods.
   - Savings on printing, fieldwork, and call center expenses.

4. **Rich Media Capabilities**
   - Supports images, videos, and audio files for interactive surveys.
   - Enhances comprehension and engagement.

5. **Real-Time Responses**
   - Data is collected instantly, allowing for real-time monitoring.
   - Enables quick decision-making based on responses.

6. **Higher Response Rates**
   - Familiarity with WhatsApp leads to increased participation.
   - Evidence from IPA projects in Colombia, Senegal, and Guinea supports this.

## WhatsApp Surveys at IPA
IPA has successfully implemented WhatsApp surveys in various projects across different regions. Some key examples include:

- **Monitoring Migration and Legal Status:** A study by IPA Colombia on [Colombia's policy to grant legal status to Venezuelan migrants](https://poverty-action.org/study/impact-temporary-working-and-residence-permits-migrants-colombia) used WhatsApp surveys to reach a mobile population. Even when phone numbers changed, WhatsApp numbers remained stable, improving follow-up success.
- **Tracking Social Protection Interventions:** WhatsApp was used to communicate project details and schedule phone surveys for studies on entrepreneurship training and social protection during COVID-19.
- **Assessing Program Spillovers:** A project on socio-emotional skills used WhatsApp surveys to track whether control group participants had received materials related to the intervention.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Key Benefits

- **Verified WhatsApp Business Account:** We use a verified IPA account with our logo as a profile picture, improving participant recognition and trust. The verified account displays IPA's name instead of an unknown number, potentially increasing response rates.
- **Message Tracking:** WhatsApp's double-check marks allow researchers to monitor survey progress by identifying:
  - Failed deliveries due to inactive phone numbers.
  - Messages that were received and read (subject to user privacy settings).
- **Scalability and Multi-Format Engagement:** The ability to send images, voice messages, and documents makes communication more effective.
- **Real-Time Data Collection:** Responses arrive instantly, allowing researchers to adapt their approach or follow up as needed.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Participant Requirements:** WhatsApp surveys work best with populations that have internet access, smartphones, and some level of technological literacy. This may limit sampling to specific geographic, age, and socioeconomic groups.
- **No Enumerator Supervision:** Without an enumerator present, verifying that participants understand survey questions can be difficult. To mitigate this, we designed surveys with clear, simple questions.
- **Privacy Limitations:** Some WhatsApp privacy settings may prevent researchers from knowing whether messages have been read.
- **Managing Expectations:** In some cases, participants expected real-time human responses. Clarifying automated interactions upfront helped mitigate confusion.

## The Role of Twilio in WhatsApp Surveys
Twilio is a cloud communication platform that allows organizations to send automated WhatsApp messages and conduct surveys. At IPA, Twilio has been used for:

- WhatsApp and SMS surveys.
- Interactive Voice Response (IVR) surveys.
- Automated reminders for data collection visits.
- Virtual call center support via WhatsApp, voice, and video.

Twilio has been tested in multiple IPA projects, including PEP, Think Equal, UEPA, Ingreso Solidario, Play to Learn, ETPV, Sisbén, and Lego. Due to its success, other IPA regional offices have adopted it for data collection and participant engagement.

GRDS provides support in planning and programming surveys or interventions via WhatsApp, SMS, and IVR through Twilio.

Every data collection method has its trade-offs, and we are not comparing all options here (we hope to publish a more detailed technical comparison in the future). However, for IPA—particularly during the disruptions of COVID-19—WhatsApp surveys have proven to be a versatile and effective tool. The more experience we gain, the better we become at using them. If you think WhatsApp surveys might be useful for your study, we encourage you to give them a try.
