By leveraging Twilio's capabilities, researchers and organizations can automate survey distribution, track responses in real-time, and ensure higher engagement rates. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Twilio for WhatsApp surveys, providing practical insights into its implementation and pricing considerations.

## Key Twilio Concepts for WhatsApp Surveys
