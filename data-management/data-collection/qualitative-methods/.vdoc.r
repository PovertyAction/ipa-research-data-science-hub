## What is a focus group?

Focus groups are one of the most widely used techniques in social research, particularly within qualitative studies. This method involves creating a discussion space where three to eight participants engage in an in-depth conversation about one or more topics.[^1]

[^1]: Jenny Kitzinger, "Qualitative Research: introducing focus groups," (1999).  BMJ 311:299-302.doi: 10.1136/bmj.311.7000.299. In a typical focus group, a **moderator** leads the discussion, ensuring active interaction among participants. The moderator's role is to ask questions that stimulate discussion, guide the conversation to gather valuable insights, and build trust with the participants. This trust is crucial to making participants feel comfortable expressing themselves freely, ensuring the discussion remains productive and focused on relevant topics.

Focus groups are artificially configured environments, characterized by collecting information related to the interaction among participants to explore their perceptions, opinions, and attitudes toward specific topics. This technique allows one to collect data on how participants communicate, share their opinions and experiences, and react to the contributions of others.

## Example: Perceptions from Venezuelan Migrants

In a focus group with Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, several common perceptions about the healthcare system emerged. While some participants acknowledged the accessibility of essential medical services as an advantage of the Colombian system, others expressed concerns about the quality of care, long wait times, and challenges in accessing specialized services, particularly due to their migratory status.

The dynamics of focus groups  allows to identify what information is censored or encouraged among participants. In this context, group conversation does not necessarily imply consensus, because during the conversation participants may misinterpret each other's accounts, question themselves and attempt to persuade each other. Disagreement is also a key component of this collection technique, as it allows exploring the diversity of opinions and the reasons behind participants' beliefs and attitudes. Overall, focus groups make it possible to identify both shared perceptions and divergences among participants on a specific topic. 

## Planning a focus group
Proper preparation is essential for the success of focus groups, ensuring that the research activity meets its field data collection objectives. This section provides detailed guidance on the planning steps that should be undertaken before conducting a focus group.

### 1. Structure your team
Ideally, focus group teams should consist of at least two (2) roles: a **moderator** and a **facilitator**. The moderator’s primary responsibility is to lead the discussion during the focus group, ensuring that the conversation remains on track and that all participants are engaged. The facilitator handles logistical activities such as setting up recording equipment, providing refreshments and incentives, setting up the space, as well as, taking notes. It is crucial to clearly define and assign these roles in advance to ensure a smooth execution of the focus group.

If budget constraints prevent hiring a facilitator, it’s important to recognize that this could negatively impact the quality of the activity and the data collected. Overburdening the moderator with both discussion and logistical duties may compromise their ability to maintain participant focus and engagement. Researchers should be aware of these potential drawbacks when planning qualitative data collection without a dedicated facilitator.

### 2. Understand your field team's skills
The quality of the information produced during qualitative fieldwork is related to the technical skills of the moderator and facilitator leading the activity to collect the information. According to Small and Calarco, certain competencies (described in Table 1 can be identified) allow the teams conducting qualitative data collection to recognize and adequately represent the diversity within the qualitative data. The skills described in Table 1 are acquired, developed, and strengthened through years of study and practice in qualitative methodologies. However, in the context of social program monitoring and evaluation, field teams are often multidisciplinary, with varying levels of experience in qualitative data collection. Whether your team is highly experienced or relatively new to qualitative research, you should study and socialize these skills and think about possible gaps and opportunities for your team to engage with the target population.

| Ability     | Description | Relevance |
| :------ | :-------------- | :-------- |
| Cognitive empathy |   The field team's ability to understand and communicate participants’ situations from their perspectives, understanding how they see the world and their roles within it.   | Allows researchers to connect more deeply with participant's realities and experiences. |
| Follow-up         |   The field team's ability to recognize when additional information is needed to answer the questions initially posed and those that arise during the research process. This ability implies curiosity and a willingness to explore new issues or doubts that emerge as data collection progresses.     | Increases the quality and robustness of data by allowing a more detailed exploration of the studied phenomenon. |

### 3. Prepare for moderation
Moderation is a fundamental aspect of focus groups. The moderator is responsible for guiding the discussion, ensuring equal participation from all members, and keeping the conversation focused on relevant topics. An effective moderator facilitates a smooth and natural discussion, creating an environment where participants feel comfortable and safe to express their opinions openly, without fear of criticism or judgment.

### 4. Plan logistics
Logistical activities are important to ensure the correct implementation of focus groups. Careful logistical planning will ensure that all the necessary elements are in place to carry out the activities, participants have been scheduled in a timely manner, and all the details surrounding the fieldwork are clear. Implementing a focus group. Based on the experience of conducting qualitative field operations in various contexts, the IPA team has identified several key practices that are essential for the logistical preparation of a focus group:

### 5. Study the script
The discussion script is a support tool that seeks to guide the conversation during the focus group according to the research objectives. It contains open-ended questions and topics designed to encourage reflection and discussion. You should study the script several times before the activity so that you will be able to explore new topics without losing sight of the objectives of the session. During this process of studying the script, identify:

::: {.callout-note}
## The role of the facilitator
In addition to understanding the script, the facilitator must also understand the research questions of the project. This will allow them to probe beyond the guide and see, during the execution of the activity, possible questions or dimensions of the problem that were not known when the script was developed.

## Conducting a focus group
To start the focus group, it is important that you introduce yourself and clearly explain the role of each member of the work team, and the overall dynamics of the session. Next, read the informed consent, ensuring all participants clearly understand the purpose of the activity and the potential risks and benefits of their participation. During this process, emphasize the confidentiality and anonymity of the information collected during the focus group. The moderator should explicitly obtain the participants' authorization to record the session. Throughout the activity, create a comfortable and calm environment that allows participants to express their opinions spontaneously and without censorship. To maintain a favorable atmosphere, you should show interest, cordiality and respect for all interventions , having an attitude of curiosity, even when the topics are extended or the opinions expressed differ from yours.
