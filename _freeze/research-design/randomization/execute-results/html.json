It's the process of randomly assigning units (individuals, households, schools, etc.) to treatment and control groups, ensuring that assignment is based purely on chance rather than any systematic factors.\n\n### Random Sampling vs. Random Assignment\n\nIt's crucial to distinguish between two related but distinct concepts:\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Random Sampling\nThe process of selecting a subset of units from a larger population where each unit has a known probability of being selected. This ensures the sample is representative of the population.\n\n![Random sampling from population](/assets/images/random-sampling.png){width=70%}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Random Assignment\nThe process of allocating sampled units to treatment and control groups using a random mechanism. This ensures groups are comparable on both observable and unobservable characteristics.\n\n![Random assignment to groups](/assets/images/random-assignment.jpeg){width=70%}\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Common Misconception\nGeographic or systematic assignment (e.g., \"northern half gets treatment, southern half gets control\") is NOT random assignment, even if the sample was randomly selected.\n:::\n\n## Basic Randomization Procedures\n\n### Complete Randomization: Fixed Proportion\n\nThis method assigns a predetermined number of units to treatment and control groups. For example, if you have 1000 participants and want exactly 400 in treatment:\n\n1. You would randomly order all 1000 participants\n2. Assign the first 400 to treatment\n3. Assign the remaining 600 to control\n\nThis ensures precise control over group sizes, which can be important when:\n\n- You have limited treatment resources (e.g., only 400 program slots)\n- You need balanced groups for statistical power\n- Implementation requires exact numbers (e.g., classroom capacity)\n\nUnlike randomization with fixed probability, this method guarantees your desired treatment/control ratio.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Steps for Complete Randomization\n1. **Compile a list** of all subjects in your sample\n2. **Determine the number** you want in treatment (and control)\n3. **Use a random number generator** to order observations randomly\n4. **Assign** the first N units to treatment, remainder to control\n\n**Advantages:** \n\n- Ensures exact group sizes\n- Simple to implement and explain\n- Equitable when resources are limited\n\n**Challenge:** Requires a complete list of participants upfront\n:::\n\n### Simple Randomization: Fixed Probability\n\nEach unit has a fixed probability (e.g., 50%) of being assigned to treatment, regardless of other units' assignments. This is like flipping a coin for each participant:\n\n- Heads (50%): Assigned to treatment\n- Tails (50%): Assigned to control\n\nFor example:\n\n- A student program might assign each applicant to treatment with 40% probability\n- A health intervention might use 30% probability for intensive treatment\n- A pilot study might start with 20% in treatment to test implementation\n\nUnlike fixed proportion, the final group sizes may vary due to chance, but the law of large numbers means they'll approach the target ratio with larger samples.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## When to Use Simple Randomization\n- **Walk-in situations** where you can't create a list in advance\n- **Rolling enrollment** contexts\n- When exact group sizes aren't critical\n\n**Important Note:** This method may result in unequal group sizes due to chance\n:::\n\n## Choosing the Unit of Randomization\n\nThe level at which you randomize is one of the most critical decisions in evaluation design.\n\n### Individual-Level Randomization\n\nRandomly assigning treatment at the individual level means each participant has an independent probability of being selected for treatment or control. This offers maximal statistical power since each individual is an independent observation.\n\nFor example, in a microfinance study, individual entrepreneurs might be randomly selected to receive business loans, while others serve as controls.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## When to Randomize at Individual Level\n**Appropriate when:**\n\n- Treatment can be delivered to individuals independently\n- Minimal risk of spillovers between individuals\n- Maximum statistical power is needed\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Patient-level medical interventions\n- Individual tutoring programs\n- Personal financial incentives\n:::\n\n### Cluster-Level Randomization\n\nCluster randomization involves assigning entire groups (like schools, villages, or health clinics) to treatment or control conditions. Instead of randomizing individual participants, all units within a cluster receive the same treatment status.\n\nFor example, in a teacher training program, entire schools might be randomized rather than individual teachers. This means:\n\n- If School A is assigned to treatment, all teachers in School A receive training\n- If School B is assigned to control, no teachers in School B receive training\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## When to Randomize at Cluster Level\n**Necessary when:**\n\n- Treatment naturally affects groups (e.g., teacher training affects whole classrooms)\n- High risk of spillovers within clusters\n- Implementation constraints require treating entire groups\n\n**Common clusters:**\n\n- Schools (for education interventions)\n- Villages (for community programs)\n- Health clinics (for health system interventions)\n\n**Statistical implications:**\n\n- Reduced statistical power due to fewer independent units\n- Need to account for intra-cluster correlation\n- Typically requires larger sample sizes\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Minimizes spillovers within natural groups\n- Often more practical to implement\n- Can capture group-level effects\n:::\n\n### Key Considerations for Choosing Randomization Level\n\n## Decision Framework\n| Unit of Measurement | Program Targeting | Spillover Potential | Statistical Power | Implementation Feasibility |\n|:-------------------|:------------------|:-------------------|:-----------------|:------------------------|\n| At what level will outcomes be measured? | How is the intervention naturally administered? | How likely are treatment effects to spread? | Which level maximizes ability to detect effects? | What's realistic given ethical, financial, and logistical constraints? |\n| **Individual:** Test scores, health metrics, income | **Individual:** Personal tutoring, cash transfers | **Low:** Personal interventions with minimal interaction | **Highest:** Individual randomization | **High:** Simple interventions, good tracking systems |\n| **Cluster:** School performance, village outcomes | **Group:** Teacher training, community programs | **High:** Social programs, shared resources | **Lower:** Cluster randomization needs larger samples | **Medium:** Requires coordination with group leaders |\n\n\n## Managing Common Challenges\n\n### Noncompliance\n\nNoncompliance occurs when units don't follow their assigned treatment status. This can happen in two ways:\n\n1. **One-Sided Noncompliance:** Only treatment group members can deviate\n  - Treatment group members don't participate (\"no-shows\")\n  - Control group can't access treatment\n\n2. **Two-Sided Noncompliance:** Both groups can deviate\n  - Treatment group members don't participate\n  - Control group members get treatment (\"crossover\")\n\n**Common causes:**\n\n- Service providers struggle to distinguish groups\n- Logistical challenges in differential treatment\n- Participant self-selection or refusal\n- Control group finding alternative ways to access treatment\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n- Randomize at provider level when possible\n- Clear marking/identification systems\n- Strong monitoring protocols\n- Document all cases of noncompliance\n- Use intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis\n- Consider instrumental variables for treatment-on-treated effects\n\n**Analysis Approaches:**\n\n1. Intention-to-Treat (ITT): Analyze by original assignment\n2. Treatment-on-Treated (TOT): Account for actual treatment received\n3. Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE): For partial compliance\n\n### Spillovers\n\nSpillovers occur when the treatment affects units beyond those directly treated, potentially contaminating the control group and biasing treatment estimates.\n\n**Types of spillovers:**\n\n- **Environmental:** Treatment changes shared conditions (e.g., reduced disease transmission)\n- **Behavioral:** Control group imitates treatment behaviors\n- **Informational:** Knowledge spreads between groups\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n- Increase geographic/social distance between groups\n- Randomize at higher level to contain spillovers\n- Design evaluation to measure spillovers explicitly\n\n**Impact on Analysis:**\n\n- Can lead to underestimated treatment effects if control group benefits\n- May require additional buffer zones between treatment and control\n- Sometimes spillovers themselves are of research interest (e.g., vaccine studies)\n\n\n## Alternative Randomization Methods\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Cross-Cutting Treatments\n\n**Purpose:** Test multiple treatment variations simultaneously and efficiently\n\n**Design Types:**\n\n- 2x2 factorial design (most common)\n- Multiple treatment arms (3+ variations)\n- Nested designs\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Tests interaction effects between treatments\n- More cost-effective than separate trials\n- Identifies optimal treatment combinations\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. List all treatment combinations\n2. Assign units randomly to each arm\n3. Track and monitor each variation separately\n4. Analyze both main effects and interactions\n\n**Example: Teacher Training + Materials**\n\n| Group | Training | Materials | Sample Size |\n|:------|:---------|:----------|:------------|\n| Control | No | No | 25% |\n| T1 | Yes | No | 25% |\n| T2 | No | Yes | 25% |\n| T3 | Yes | Yes | 25% |\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Phase-In Design\n\n**Purpose:** Ensure all units eventually receive treatment while maintaining a valid control group\n\n**Design Types:**\n\n- Sequential rollout (most common)\n- Random order phase-in\n- Stratified phase-in\n- Time-lagged treatments\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Ethically sound (all units get treatment)\n- Maintains experimental control\n- Allows program refinement\n- Multiple measurement points\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. Determine number and timing of phases\n2. Randomize order of treatment receipt\n3. Monitor phase transitions carefully\n4. Analyze data from each phase\n\n**Example: Community Program Rollout**\n\n| Phase | Treatment Group | Control Group | Timeline |\n|:------|:---------------|:--------------|:---------|\n| 1 | 25% | 75% | Months 1-3 |\n| 2 | 50% | 50% | Months 4-6 |\n| 3 | 75% | 25% | Months 7-9 |\n| 4 | 100% | 0% | Months 10-12 |\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Encouragement Design\n\n**Purpose:** Evaluate impact when treatment cannot be denied but participation can be influenced\n\n**Design Types:**\n\n- Information campaigns\n- Personalized reminders\n- Application assistance\n- Cost subsidies\n- Behavioral nudges\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Ethical when services are entitlements\n- Maintains experimental validity\n- Measures both take-up and impact\n- Identifies barriers to participation\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. Design effective encouragement strategy\n2. Randomize who receives encouragement\n3. Track both encouragement and participation\n4. Use instrumental variables analysis\n\n**Example: Health Insurance Program**\n\n| Group | Encouragement | Access | Expected Take-up |\n|:------|:--------------|:-------|:----------------|\n| Treatment | Active outreach | Yes | 60% |\n| Control | No outreach | Yes | 30% |\n| Difference | Information + reminders | None | 30% |\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Stratified Randomization\n\n**Purpose:** Ensure balance on key characteristics across treatment groups, especially important with small samples or critical covariates\n\n**Design Types:**\n\n- Geographic stratification\n- Demographic characteristics\n- Baseline performance levels\n- Multiple variable combinations\n- Covariate-adaptive methods\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Improves statistical precision\n- Guarantees balance on key variables\n- Reduces chance of unlucky draws\n- Facilitates subgroup analysis\n- Increases credibility of results\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. Select key stratification variables\n2. Create strata combinations\n3. Randomize within each stratum\n4. Verify balance across strata\n\n**Example: Education Program**\n\n| Stratum | Baseline Score | Gender | Treatment Share |\n|:--------|:--------------|:--------|:----------------|\n| Low-Male | Below median | Male | 50% |\n| Low-Female | Below median | Female | 50% |\n| High-Male | Above median | Male | 50% |\n| High-Female | Above median | Female | 50% |\n\n:::\n\n## Practical Implementation in Stata\n\n### How Computers \"Think\" About Randomization\nStata uses a **pseudo-random number generator** that follows complex mathematical formulas to generate numbers that are indistinguishable from truly random numbers for practical purposes. \n\n**Key concept:** The generator starts with a \"seed\" - a starting number that determines the entire sequence of random numbers that follows. The same seed will always produce the same sequence, making randomization reproducible.\n\n**Example:** Think of it like a recipe - if you start with the same ingredients (seed) and follow the same steps (algorithm), you'll always get the same result.\n\n**Best practices for seeds:**\n\n- Use a different seed for each project\n- Choose seeds randomly (e.g., from random.org or dice rolls)\n- Set only one seed per do-file\n- Always set the Stata version at the beginning (algorithms change between versions)\n\n### Practice Exercise: School Supply Program\n\n**Context:**\nYou're evaluating a program that provides school supplies to students. You have:\n- 500 students across 10 schools\n- Budget to treat 250 students\n- Need to ensure balance across grades\n\n**Your Task:**\nFollow these steps to create a randomization plan:\n\n1. **Data Setup**\n\n  - Create a dataset with 500 students, assigned to 10 schools and grades 1 to 5\n\n::: {#fa82f8e8 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n%%stata\nclear\nset obs 500\ngen student_id = _n\ngen school_id = ceil(_n/50)         // 10 schools, 50 students each\ngen grade = mod(_n-1,5) + 1         // Grades 1â5, evenly distributed\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n. clear\n\n. set obs 500\nNumber of observations (_N) was 0, now 500.\n\n. gen student_id = _n\n\n. gen school_id = ceil(_n/50)         // 10 schools, 50 students each\n\n. gen grade = mod(_n-1,5) + 1         // Grades 1â5, evenly distributed\n\n. \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. **Set Seed**\n\n  - Set a random seed for replicability.\n\n::: {#67a2b52a .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n%%stata\nset seed 12345\n```\n:::\n\n\n3. **Stratify by Grade**\n\n  - From the grade variable created, ensure each grade is represented.\n\n::: {#89268092 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n%%stata\ntab grade\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n      grade |      Freq.

Always include a unique ID as the last sorting variable:\n\n```stata\n* Check if ID is unique\nisid unique_id\n\n* Sort by unique ID before generating random numbers\nsort unique_id\ngen rand = runiform()\n\n* When sorting by strata and random number, include unique ID last\nsort region rand unique_id\n```\nThis prevents Stata from randomly breaking ties, ensuring your randomization is perfectly reproducible.\n:::\n\n\nFor more detailed guidance on randomization and power calculations in Stata, see the [Stata power and sample size reference manual (Release 18)](https://www.stata.com/manuals/power.pdf) [^1].\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n- [IPA Randomization Guide with Example Do-files](https://ipastorage.box.com/s/sslf9h67yaejnhn3zz02ez3k508irzu8)\n- [William Gould on Random Number Seeds](https://blog.stata.com/2016/03/10/how-to-generate-random-numbers-in-stata/)\n- [StataCorp Blog Posts on Pseudo-Random Number Generators](https://blog.stata.com/tag/random-numbers/)\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### IPA Example: Balsakhi Tutoring Program\n\nThe Balsakhi program in India is a classic example of rigorous randomization in education research (Banerjee et al., 2007; Duflo, Glennerster, & Kremer, 2007):\n\n**Context:**\n\nImplemented by Pratham, the Balsakhi program provided remedial tutoring to academically weaker primary school students in Mumbai and Vadodara. The goal was to help students who were falling behind catch up with their peers.\n\n**Randomization:**  \n\n- **Unit:** 122 schools were randomized to either receive the Balsakhi intervention or serve as controls.\n- **Stratification:** Randomization was stratified by language of instruction (Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, English) and by gender composition (boys', girls', and co-ed schools) to ensure balance across key characteristics.\n\n**Implementation:**  \n\n- Within treatment schools, Balsakhis (local young women trained as tutors) worked with the lowest-performing students, identified using baseline test scores.\n- Strict protocols were followed to prevent contamination between treatment and control schools, including separate training and monitoring teams.\n- Detailed documentation and monitoring ensured fidelity to the randomization plan.\n\n**Results:**  \n\n- The program led to a significant improvement of 0.14 standard deviations in test scores for all students, and even larger gains for the weakest students.\n- The study demonstrated the power of cluster-level randomization and the importance of stratification for balance.\n\n**References:**  \n\n- Banerjee, A., Cole, S., Duflo, E., & Linden, L.
