## WhatsApp Surveys: An Innovative and Low-Cost Solution for Remote Data Collection

Data collection during the pandemic presented various challenges for researchers. At IPA Colombia, this situation led us to explore and test new tools such as WhatsApp surveys. Here, we would like to share some specific situations in which WhatsApp has been a useful alternative to in-person data collection and some of the lessons we have learned throughout the process.

Projects like entrepreneurship training and social protection during COVID-19 have used WhatsApp to communicate project information and plan calls for phone surveys. Another project focused on teaching socio-emotional skills to young children used WhatsApp surveys to monitor potential outcomes by checking whether participants in the control group received resources related to the treatment between data collections.

## Advantages and limitations of WhatsApp Surveys

At IPA, we've started to rely on WhatsApp as one method for collecting data remotely, driven by its unique strengths that greatly enhance the efficiency and impact of our initiatives. Here are some of the main reasons why we have selected WhatsApp:

**Pros**

* WhatsApp's massive user base of 2 billion individuals globally ensures that our outreach is extensive and inclusive, covering a diverse range of demographics and geographical regions. This widespread presence enables us to gather insights from different demographic groups.
WhatsApp has high engagement levels and widespread familiarity. With people across the globe already using WhatsApp for everyday communication, our surveys seamlessly integrate into their digital routines. This familiarity encourages participation and enables respondents to quickly and conveniently share their perspectives using smartphones, fostering a more accessible and inclusive data collection process. 
* WhatsApp is a cost-effective solution that significantly reduces traditional paper, printing, and fieldwork expenses. 
* WhatsApp's capability to handle various types of media, including text, images, audio, and video, enriches our surveys with diverse content, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of respondents' perspectives.

**Cons**

* User Trust: Users consider WhatsApp a private and secure messaging platform. If they feel that their data is being collected in ways that violate their privacy or trust, it may lead to a negative perception of the organization or business. Therefore, sensitive information should not be asked via WhatsApp.
* Opt-In and Consent Challenges: While obtaining opt-in and consent is crucial for ethical data collection on WhatsApp, researchers need to be mindful of the challenges associated with user trust. Due to existing mistrust with WhatsApp, participants may approach data collection interactions skeptically. Researchers must ensure that participants have a clear option to opt out, and it is essential to obtain explicit upfront consent for these interactions. 
* Simplicity of Surveys: Since this is a remote data collection method, questionnaires must be simple. If presented with a complicated survey, participants may have doubts or concerns that no enumerator can help resolve. Therefore, it is advisable to use simple instruments for data collection to minimize attrition and ensure effective participation.
