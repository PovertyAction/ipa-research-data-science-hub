# IPA Writing Guideline: Maintain a professional tone
# While we encourage staff to use their own voice, IPA's tone is formal. Stay
# away from slang, figures of speech, contractions, and abbreviated words.
# Avoid the use of the first person (I, we, us) and second person (you), and
# instead use the third person (IPA).
