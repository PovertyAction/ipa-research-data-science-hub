# IPA Writing Guideline: Attention spans are getting smaller and smaller.
# Short sentences are useful to keep the readerâ€™s attention. Avoid one-paragraph
# sentences. Each sentence should convey a single idea. Do not ramble; focus on
# the main message. Avoid fancy adjectives and adverbs when simpler alternatives
# are available
