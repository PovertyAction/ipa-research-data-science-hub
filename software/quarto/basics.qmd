:::{.custom-summary-block}
Learn the essential Quarto markdown syntax and formatting techniques to create professional, interactive documents for research and data science.
:::

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
## Key Takeaways
* Quarto combines markdown text with code to create dynamic documents
* Master basic formatting, code blocks, and callouts for effective communication
* Use interactive features like tabsets and collapsible sections to organize content
* Apply consistent styling across multiple output formats
:::

## What Makes Quarto Special?

Quarto lets you combine text, code, and visualizations in a single document. Write regular text and seamlessly include code that runs and displays results.

## Text Formatting Essentials

### Basic Text Styling

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code
```markdown
*This text is italic*
**This text is bold** 
***This text is bold and italic***
~~This text has strikethrough~~
`This is inline code`
```

## Result
*This text is italic*  
**This text is bold**  
***This text is bold and italic***  
~~This text has strikethrough~~  
`This is inline code`

:::

### Headers

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code
```markdown
# Main Title (H1)
## Section Header (H2)  
### Subsection Header (H3)
#### Smaller Header (H4)
```

## Result
Headers create structure and automatic navigation links.

:::

## Lists for Clear Organization

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code
```markdown
# Unordered Lists
* Research Design
* Data Collection
  + Phone Surveys
  + In-Person Interviews
* Data Analysis

# Ordered Lists
1. Design your survey
2. Collect pilot data
3. Refine your instrument
4. Launch full data collection
```

## Result
**Unordered Lists**
* Research Design
* Data Collection
  + Phone Surveys
  + In-Person Interviews
* Data Analysis

**Ordered Lists**
1. Design your survey
2. Collect pilot data
3. Refine your instrument
4. Launch full data collection

:::

## Code Blocks

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code
````markdown
# Simple code display
```
summary(data)
mean(variable)
```

# With syntax highlighting
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.head())
```

# Executable code cells
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```
````

## Result
**Simple Code Display:**
```
summary(data)
mean(variable)
```

**With Syntax Highlighting:**
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.head())
```

**Executable cells run code and show output in your document.**

## Callouts

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code
```markdown
::: {.callout-note}
This is a standard note callout.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Pro Tip"}  
Always pilot your survey before deployment!
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Remember to back up your data.
:::

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
IRB approval required before data collection.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

## Custom Styling

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code
```markdown
::: {.border}
This content has a border around it.
:::

::: {.custom-summary-block}
This matches the site's summary block styling.
:::
```

## Result
::: {.border}
This content has a border around it.
:::

::: {.custom-summary-block}
This matches the site's summary block styling.

## Mathematical Expressions

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code
```markdown
# Inline math
The formula $E = mc^2$ is famous.

# Block equations
$$
\text{Treatment Effect} = \bar{Y}_{\text{treatment}} - \bar{Y}_{\text{control}}
$$
```

## Result
**Inline math:** The formula $E = mc^2$ is famous.

**Block equations:**
$$
\text{Treatment Effect} = \bar{Y}_{\text{treatment}} - \bar{Y}_{\text{control}}
$$

## Tables

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code
```markdown
| Survey Type | Response Rate | Cost per Response |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Phone       | 65%           | $12               |
| In-person   | 85%           | $45               |
| WhatsApp    | 78%           | $3                |
```

## Result
| Survey Type | Response Rate | Cost per Response |

## Next Steps

- **Create Professional Documents:** Combine these elements for research reports and analysis guides
- **Customize Your Style:** Add a `brand.yml` file for consistent styling [Learn more](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html)
- **Share Your Work:** Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or other platforms
- **Collaborate:** Use version control with Git to track changes

::: {.callout-tip title="Ready to Practice?"}
Try creating your own Quarto document using these elements. Start simple with headers, text formatting, and a callout, then add more complex features.
