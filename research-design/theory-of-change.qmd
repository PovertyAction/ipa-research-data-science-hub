## What is a Theory of Change?

A **Theory of Change (ToC)** is a visual or narrative representation that maps out how a program's activities are expected to lead to its intended outcomes, including the assumptions that underpin each step.

It helps clarify:

- What a program does
- What changes are expected to result from those activities
- Under what assumptions those changes will occur
- How learning and evaluation can be aligned to validate the model

**Example:**  
If a program aims to improve youth employment, its ToC should describe the steps‚Äîlike training and job placement services‚Äîthat lead to job acquisition, while making clear any contextual assumptions.

## Components of a Theory of Change

| Element        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Activities** | What the program does (e.g., train facilitators, deliver cash transfers)    |
| **Outputs**    | Direct products of activities (e.g., # of facilitators trained)             |
| **Outcomes**   | Changes in behavior, knowledge, skills (short/intermediate)                 |
| **Impacts**    | Final, long-term goals (e.g., reduction in poverty, improved health)        |

## Assumptions and Risks in a ToC

Every link in a ToC involves assumptions about how and why change happens. Some of these assumptions might be wrong, uncertain, or context-dependent‚Äîand should be tested.

**Risk** = A specific event or condition that may prevent success  
**Assumption** = A condition that must hold true for the ToC to work

### Table: Writing better risks and assumptions

| Bad Example                                                                 | Good Example                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **General:** In-person classes are disrupted                                | **Specific:** In-person instruction is disrupted by COVID and students cannot be reached remotely with content.|
| **Unclear:** Content is too complex to apply                                | **Detailed:** Applying all 5 key practices is not feasible for most teachers due to other required priorities that take time in the classroom |
| **Multiple risks:** Teachers do not have the time and tools to apply the curriculum | **Disaggregated:** Teachers do not have the time to adopt the practices in the classroom<br>Teachers do not have the tools to apply the curriculum |

To identify key risks, start by prioritizing the most ‚ÄúImportant‚Äù and ‚ÄúUncertain‚Äù risks to the project:

- **Importance**: If this risk comes to pass, would it cause a major disruption to the project?
- **Uncertainty**: Do we have reason to believe that this risk will occur?

---

## Prioritizing Risks

Focus on the risks that are:

- **Important**: If it occurs, it would seriously affect the outcome
- **Uncertain**: We don't yet have good evidence about its likelihood

---

## Learning Questions to Validate Assumptions

Use learning questions to convert assumptions into something measurable.

- **Assumption:** Community members can serve as facilitators  
- **Learning Question:** How can we identify qualified facilitators in the community?

These questions help design pilots, qualitative interviews, or secondary analysis to guide decision-making.

---

## Defining a Learning Approach

Different learning approaches may be needed depending on the type of assumption or risk:

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### Piloting
A pilot is a small-scale test of the activity with a subset of the intended audience, closely simulating the full implementation. Pilots allow you to gather both quantitative and qualitative data to assess feasibility, identify challenges, and refine your approach before scaling up.
:::

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### Focus Groups
Focus group discussions use qualitative methods to explore ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions and uncover deeper perceptions or needs that quantitative data may miss. They can be conducted at any stage of the intervention and are especially valuable for addressing risks related to program relevance and design.
:::

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### Administrative Data
Existing administrative data can be leveraged to test certain assumptions. For example, data from a previous program round or early results from the current round can help validate key conditions or inform decisions about scaling or adapting the intervention.
:::

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}
### Expert Interviews
Not all staff can be experts in every area. Some assumptions can be quickly validated by consulting individuals with relevant expertise‚Äîsuch as government officials, local stakeholders, subject matter experts, or practitioners with experience in similar contexts.

## üîç IPA‚Äôs Right-Fit Evidence Team

IPA‚Äôs **Right-Fit Evidence (RFE)** team supports practitioners in developing **clear, actionable, and evidence-informed theories of change**, and aligning them with appropriate measurement strategies.

### What they do:

- Facilitate **ToC workshops** with partners
- Provide **feedback** on logical consistency and evidence base
- Help prioritize assumptions for testing
- Support design of pilots and learning agendas

### Tools and Resources from RFE

- ‚úÖ ToC template (visual)  ‚Äì coming soon
- ‚úÖ Assumption mapping guide  ‚Äì coming soon
- ‚úÖ Risk-prioritization worksheet  ‚Äì coming soon
