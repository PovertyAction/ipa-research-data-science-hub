This resource explains how to develop a robust Theory of Change for impact evaluations, linking program activities to outcomes through evidence-based pathways.

## Key Takeaways
- A Theory of Change maps how program activities lead to intended outcomes through clear, logical pathways
- Strong ToCs must be active (specific actions), clear (distinct components), and detailed (sufficient for M&E)
- Every ToC pathway relies on explicit assumptions and risks that need monitoring and validation

## **What is a Theory of Change?**
A **Theory of Change (ToC)** is a visual or narrative representation that maps how program activities lead to intended outcomes, including underlying assumptions.

**Key Clarifications:**

- What a program does  
- Expected changes from activities  
- Critical assumptions  
- Alignment with evaluation  

**Example:**  
A youth employment program's ToC should link training activities to job acquisition, specifying assumptions about labor market conditions.

## **Characteristics of a Strong ToC**
::: {.callout-tip}
### 1. Active
Specific actions the organization will implement (excluding internal processes).
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
### 2. Clear
Distinct components in the causal chain.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
### 3. Logical
Non-chronological but coherent progression.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
### 4. Detailed
Sufficient for M&E framework development.

| Element        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Activities** | Program actions (e.g., training facilitators)                               |
| **Outputs**    | Direct products (e.g., # trained)                                           |
| **Outcomes**   | Behavioral/knowledge changes (short/intermediate)                           |
| **Impacts**    | Long-term goals (e.g., poverty reduction)                                   |

## üß© Assumptions and Risks in a Theory of Change

Every link in a Theory of Change relies on **assumptions**, conditions that must hold true for the pathway to work. At the same time, programs face **risks**, external events or internal issues that could disrupt the expected change.

Understanding and documenting these explicitly helps guide where to collect evidence, focus learning, and adapt programming.

### üîç Key Definitions

- **Assumption:** A condition that must be true for the causal pathway to succeed.
- **Risk:** A specific event or condition that may prevent success or disrupt the pathway.

::: {.callout-tip}
 Assumptions are often "hidden logic" behind why a program should work. Risks are potential disruptions to that logic.
:::

### üìà Examples: Improving Risk and Assumption Clarity

| üî¥ Weak Formulation                   | ‚úÖ Improved Formulation                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Classes are disrupted"              | "COVID restrictions prevent remote content delivery for 40% of students"                         |
| "Teachers lack time and tools"       | "Time constraints limit adoption of ‚â•3 practices/week due to curriculum and administrative load" |
| "Content may not be relevant"        | "Teachers report that 60% of content is misaligned with national standards"                     |
| "No internet access"                 | "70% of schools in rural areas lack stable internet access during school hours"                 |

## üö¶ Prioritizing Risks

Not all risks are equal. Focus on those that are both:

- **Important:** If the risk occurs, it would significantly impact success.
- **Uncertain:** There is little or no existing evidence on its likelihood or effect.

You can prioritize risks using a simple 2x2 matrix of Importance vs. Uncertainty to guide where learning and mitigation efforts are most valuable.

### ‚úÖ Example Approach

| Category           | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Assumption**      | Local leaders are willing and available to support facilitator recruitment. |
| **Learning Question** | What proportion of community leaders are available and willing to refer facilitators? |
| **Risk**            | Political events disrupt community mobilization efforts in rural areas.     |

By identifying and prioritizing assumptions and risks, programs can design more **resilient strategies**, validate the most critical elements of their theory of change, and adapt based on evidence.

## **Learning Approaches**
::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Piloting
A pilot is a small-scale test of the activity with a subset of the intended audience, closely simulating the full implementation. Pilots allow you to gather both quantitative and qualitative data to assess feasibility, identify challenges, and refine your approach before scaling up.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Focus Groups
Focus group discussions use qualitative methods to explore 'why' questions and uncover deeper perceptions or needs that quantitative data may miss. They can be conducted at any stage of the intervention and are especially valuable for addressing risks related to program relevance and design.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Administrative Data
Existing administrative data can be leveraged to test certain assumptions. For example, data from a previous program round or early results from the current round can help validate key conditions or inform decisions about scaling or adapting the intervention.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Expert Interviews
Not all staff can be experts in every area. Some assumptions can be quickly validated by consulting individuals with relevant expertise‚Äîsuch as government officials, local stakeholders, subject matter experts, or practitioners with experience in similar contexts.

## **IPA's Right-Fit Evidence Team**

IPA's **Right-Fit Evidence (RFE)** team leads the organization's work on developing and applying **Theory of Change frameworks**. They have created practical tools and guidance to help teams design clear, evidence-informed ToCs, identify critical assumptions, and prioritize learning.

Their resources are widely used across IPA and with partners to ensure that evaluation and learning efforts are grounded in a strong causal logic.

Additional resources: including templates, worksheets, and practical guides, will be available soon in our Resource Library.
