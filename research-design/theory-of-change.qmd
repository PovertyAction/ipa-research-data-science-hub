## Key Takeaways
- A **Theory of Change** maps how program activities lead to intended outcomes through clear, logical pathways
- Strong ToCs must be **active** (specific actions), **clear** (distinct components), **logical** (causal relationships), and **detailed** (sufficient for M&E)
- Every ToC pathway relies on **explicit assumptions** and **risks** that need monitoring and validation
:::

## What is a Theory of Change?
A **Theory of Change (ToC)** is a visual or narrative representation that maps how program activities lead to intended outcomes, including underlying assumptions.

**Key Clarifications:**

- What a program does  
- Expected changes from activities  
- Critical assumptions  
- Alignment with evaluation  

**Example:**  
A youth employment program's ToC should link training activities to job acquisition, specifying assumptions about labor market conditions.

---

## Characteristics of a Strong ToC
::: {.callout-tip}
### 1. Active
Specific actions the organization will implement (excluding internal processes).
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## 2. Outputs
**Definition**: The direct products of activities

**Characteristics**:

- Immediately measurable
- Under direct control of the program
- One output per activity

**Example**: "Caregivers attend and complete 10 training sessions"
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## 3. Initial Outcomes
**Definition**: Short-term changes in participants

**Types of changes**:

- Knowledge
- Attitudes
- Beliefs
- Behaviors (sometimes)

**Measurement**: During or immediately after implementation
**Attribution**: Directly attributable to program activities
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
### 4. Detailed
Sufficient for M&E framework development.

## Components of a Theory of Change

![Theory of Change Components Diagram](/assets/images/toc_1.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

## Characteristics of a Strong Theory of Change

### The Four Essential Qualities

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## 1. Active
**Activities use specific action verbs**:

- ✅ Good: "Train 20 facilitators in child development"
- ❌ Weak: "Support child development"

**Focus on what the organization does**, not internal processes
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## 2. Clear
**Each component is distinct and specific**:

- Same level of detail across components
- One output per activity
- No overlapping elements

**All aspects of the program are represented**
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## 3. Logical
**Arrows represent causal relationships, not chronology**:

- Each link shows how one element causes the next
- The pathway makes sense conceptually
- No logical leaps or missing steps

**Example**:

- Logical: Training → Increased knowledge → Applied skills → Higher income
- Not logical: Training → Higher income (missing intermediate steps)
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## 4. Detailed
**Sufficient detail for monitoring and evaluation**:

- Distinguishes between initial and intermediate outcomes
- Includes all necessary steps in the causal chain
- Specific enough to guide measurement

**Helps identify**:

- What outputs to monitor during implementation
- Which outcomes to measure at different stages
- When to conduct evaluations
:::

## Assumptions and Risks

Every arrow in a Theory of Change represents assumptions about how change happens. Making these explicit is crucial for learning and adaptation.

### Understanding Assumptions

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## What Are Assumptions?
**Definition**: Conditions that must hold true for the causal pathway to work

**Examples**:

- Participants will attend sessions if scheduled conveniently
- New knowledge will be retained and applied
- Market conditions will remain stable enough for businesses to grow

**Why they matter**: Unmet assumptions can break the causal chain
:::

### Identifying and Managing Risks

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## From Assumptions to Risks
**Risk**: A specific threat to an assumption being met

**Examples of improving risk specification**:

| Weak Risk Statement | Strong Risk Statement |
|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| "Low attendance" | "Work schedules prevent 40% of participants from attending morning sessions" |
| "Content not relevant" | "60% of business curriculum doesn't match local market conditions" |
| "No behavior change" | "Social norms discourage women from starting businesses independently" |
:::

### Prioritizing Risks

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Risk Assessment Matrix
Focus learning efforts on risks that are both:

1. **Important**: Would significantly impact success if they occur
2. **Uncertain**: Limited evidence about likelihood or mitigation strategies

**Priority quadrants**:

- High importance + High uncertainty = **Priority for testing**
- High importance + Low uncertainty = **Standard mitigation**
- Low importance + High uncertainty = **Monitor only**
- Low importance + Low uncertainty = **Acknowledge but don't focus**
:::

## Learning Approaches

Different methods help test assumptions and understand risks at various stages of implementation.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Piloting

- **When to use**: Before full implementation
- **Purpose**: Test feasibility and refine approach
- **Methods**: Small-scale implementation with intensive monitoring
- **Example**: Test training curriculum with 2-3 groups before scaling
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Focus Groups

- **When to use**: Any stage, especially for understanding "why"
- **Purpose**: Explore perceptions, motivations, and barriers
- **Methods**: Facilitated group discussions
- **Example**: Understand why attendance is lower than expected
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Administrative Data Analysis

- **When to use**: During implementation
- **Purpose**: Track outputs and early outcomes
- **Methods**: Analyze program records and monitoring data
- **Example**: Review attendance records to identify patterns
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Expert Consultation

- **When to use**: Design phase or when facing specific challenges
- **Purpose**: Leverage specialized knowledge
- **Methods**: Interviews or advisory meetings
- **Example**: Consult labor economists about local market conditions
:::

<!-- ## Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Theory of Change 

### The Seven-Step Process

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Step 1: Define Your Ultimate Goal
**Start with the end in mind**: What long-term change do you want to achieve?

**Tips**:

- Be specific about the target population
- Focus on measurable changes
- Align with organizational mission

**Example**: "Improve sustainable economic stability and wellbeing of migrant families"
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Step 2: Identify All Activities
**List what you will do** with participants:

- Training sessions
- Service delivery
- Material distribution
- Infrastructure improvements

**Remember**: Exclude internal processes like planning or hiring
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Step 3: Define Outputs
**For each activity, identify the direct product**:

- One output per activity
- Must be measurable
- Under your control

**Example**:

- Activity: "Deliver business training"
- Output: "100 participants complete training"
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Step 4: Specify Initial Outcomes
**What changes immediately** in participants?

- Knowledge gains
- Attitude shifts
- Skill development
- Initial behavior changes

**These should be**:

- Directly attributable to activities
- Measurable during/after implementation
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Step 5: Identify Intermediate Outcomes
**What happens next** as a result of initial changes?

- Applied skills
- Sustained behavior changes
- Early impacts on life circumstances

**Consider**: External factors that might influence these
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Step 6: Define Final Outcomes
**Connect back to your ultimate goal**:

- Should align with Step 1
- Represent meaningful life changes
- May take years to achieve
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Expert Interviews
Not all staff can be experts in every area. Some assumptions can be quickly validated by consulting individuals with relevant expertise—such as government officials, local stakeholders, subject matter experts, or practitioners with experience in similar contexts.

## IPA's Right-Fit Evidence Team

IPA's **Right-Fit Evidence (RFE)** team has developed practical tools and frameworks for creating and using Theories of Change effectively.

### Key Principles

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Right-Fit Evidence Philosophy
**Match methods to learning needs**:

- Not every question needs an RCT
- Start with the decision you need to make
- Use the most efficient method that provides sufficient confidence

**Iterative learning**:

- Test assumptions progressively
- Adapt based on evidence
- Document changes and rationale
:::

### Resources and Support

## Available Resources
**Templates and Tools**:

- ToC development worksheets
- Assumption mapping guides
- Risk prioritization matrices

**Capacity Building**:

- Workshops on ToC development
- Peer review processes
- Community of practice

**Technical Assistance**:

- Direct support for complex programs
- Review and feedback services
- Connection to subject matter experts
:::

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Pitfall 1: Too Vague
**Problem**: Using general terms like "improve wellbeing" or "strengthen capacity"
**Solution**: Be specific about what will change and how you'll measure it
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Pitfall 2: Missing Steps
**Problem**: Jumping from training to long-term impact without intermediate steps
**Solution**: Think through each necessary change in the causal chain
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Pitfall 3: Overly Complex
**Problem**: Including every possible pathway and outcome
**Solution**: Focus on the main causal pathways; document others separately
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Pitfall 4: Static Document
**Problem**: Creating a ToC once and never updating it
**Solution**: Review and revise based on learning; document changes
