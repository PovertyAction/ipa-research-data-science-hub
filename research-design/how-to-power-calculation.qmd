## When to Use Power Calculations

Power calculations help researchers determine the feasibility and design parameters of their studies before data collection begins. Use power calculations to:

- Plan adequate sample sizes for your research budget
- Set realistic expectations for effect detection
- Justify sample size decisions to funders and reviewers
- Compare different study design options

This guide demonstrates three common power calculation scenarios using a hypothetical education intervention in India.

## Practical Tools and Applications in Stata

### Using the `power` Command in Stata

This guide uses Stata's `power` command to perform sample size and power calculations, and to create sensitivity tables and graphs.[^3]

ðŸ“Œ **Type this in Stata for help:**

```stata
help power
```

The India education intervention example illustrates three types of power analysis:

## ðŸ§® Case 1: Estimate Required Sample Size

**Goal:** Determine how many participants you need to detect an expected effect.

**Assumptions:**

- Effect size or minimum detectable effect: 0.2 S.D.
- Statistical power: 80%
- Variance of the outcome variable: 1 S.D.
- A single treatment group and a control group
- A single post-treatment data collection at endline
- Program randomization at the individual child level
- Perfect compliance
- No attrition
- No additional controls

**Stata code:**

```{python}
%%stata
power twomeans 0 0.2 , power(0.8) sd(1)
```

This tells Stata to calculate the required sample size for each groupâ€”treatment and controlâ€”to detect a 0.2 S.D. effect. The required study sample size to achieve a power of 80% is 788 students: 394 in the treatment group and 394 in the control group.

**Stata code:**

Now, suppose researchers expect a larger treatment effect of 0.4 standard deviations instead of 0.2 S.D., keeping all other assumptions the same. To calculate the required sample size for this new scenario:

```{python}
%%stata
power twomeans 0 0.4 , power(0.8) sd(1)
```

**Stata code:**

Now, changing the assumption: **What if researchers want to increase the statistical power to 90%?**

To calculate the required sample size for an effect size of 0.4 S.D. and 90% power:

```{python}
%%stata
power twomeans 0 0.2 , power(0.9) sd(1)
```

The required sample size would increase to 1,054.

## ðŸ§® Case 2: Estimate Minimum Detectable Effect

**Goal:**  Find the smallest effect size you can detect given your sample size.

**Assumptions:**

- Sample size: 1,000 students with 500 per group
- Power: 80%
- Variance of the outcome variable: 1 S.D

**Stata code:**

```{python}
%%stata
power twomeans 0 , n(1000) power(0.8) sd(1)
```

This calculates the minimum effect size you can detect with the given sample size.

**Stata code:**

As shown in the graph, with 500, 750, 1,000, 1,250, and 1,500 students, researchers can detect smaller treatment effects as the sample size increases.

```{python}
%%stata
power twomeans 0 , n(500(250)1500) power(0.8) sd(1) graph
```

## ðŸ§® Case 3: Estimate Power for a Given Sample Size and Effect

**Goal:** Determine the statistical power based on your sample size and expected effect.

**Assumptions:**

- Study sample size: 1,000
- Effect size: 0.2 S.D.
- Variance of the outcome variable: 1 S.D.

**Stata code:**

```{python}
%%stata
power twomeans 0 0.2 , n(1000) sd(1)
```

The estimated power under these assumptions is 0.8,848.

**Stata code:**

Smaller samples lead to less power. As sample size increases, studies reach a larger probability of avoiding a type II error or false negative.
In the graph, as the sample size increases, the estimated power also increases. This means studies are more likely to detect a true effect with a larger sample.

```{python}
%%stata
power twomeans 0 0.2 , n(100(100)1000) sd(1) graph
```
